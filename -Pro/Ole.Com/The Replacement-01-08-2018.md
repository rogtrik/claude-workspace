# The Replacement

     #OleCom
We are waiting to see what the next move will be once our partners are done waiting to see what their next move will be while now both A+E and HBO are in the middle of enormous and complex deals. We need to make our moves preemptively and avoid a change that would lessen the level of oversight and influence over the JVs as current and future revenue generators. We are overlooking very siloed relatively old structures in need of a clear and quick succession plan with a look towards digital media delivery, digital tech services and branded and programmatic advertising as the respective future for each of our areas of business.
