     **Give affiliates whatever they want. Become their launch partner for all their new services and benefit from all the additional promotion and presence that we will surely get by being a main partner of theirs in their final push against being commoditized. As an additional benefit the consumer's perception of our brands will increase exponentially if we are the only ones offering x amount or y quality of content.**

In the meantime invest in getting the rights and technology necessary to be a leader in the TVE/VOD front as well as reorganize the organization with clarity on new goals regarding where the company is headed. No more confusion and hurry up and wait.

Add all other content sources that we can wrangle into affiliate type relationships that could eventually evolve into OTT services without much effort. All our partner's brands as well as other players that have been pushed put of the pay tv landscape or are some that are still looking to get in. BBC, ZDF, Spark, eSports, bLeague Sports. 

Once renewals come around on our affiliate contracts the landscape will have changed and much of the current change will have possibly settled lightly. At that moment if we play our cards right we will have leverage to once again apply our a take it or leave it approach. TODAY we are pretending to have this approach and we simply are not a united front and are not playing ball like the other groups are... if we keep this position without budging or without in the meantime working on a master plan b then once we do we will fall hard. We can get over this turbulent and have the opportunity of benefiting from the confusion but this is only if we become truly valuable in this new environment and provide the best experience for the viewer.
