Clearly there has been economic success. Our businesses have played a foundational role and enjoyed a truly special time in the Latin American entertainment industry. In particular pay television and radio. This success has lead to wonderful profits and influential positions in an already extremely influential industry. 
This is due to the guiding strategic leadership and spiritually thanks to all the talented hard working people that comprise these organizations. But also thanks to an incalculable amount of environmental variables that we have only been able to perceive through limited observation and metrics until very recently and we are still seeing through a peephole. We were very lucky. We rode a great wave.
What we do is selectively make or acquire content and then distribute and promote it to serve an audience. We have utilized both advertising and subscriptions business models effectively. We have leveraged a technological advantage that has driven our companies to stay at the forefront of their markets. 
Our industry like many others has been disrupted through the advent of digital media and distribution and has created opportunities for new players that can leverage the new tools to do the same job in a better way. Especially for the consumer. 
Playground is a great first step but it is tepid. IVC and Actualidad can only be seen coldly and factually as passion projects. Our channel ventures need complete overhauls to face this new landscape and we are moving too slow.
We need to once again think fresh. Look at these new tools at our disposal and come up with a way to once again do what we have already done successfully.
