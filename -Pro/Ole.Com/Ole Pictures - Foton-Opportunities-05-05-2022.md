     **Assumptions and Proposal June 2022**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     What we were already discussing with a focus on using the investment in development opportunities.
Investment Route - 1M yearly. 2.58M low water mark for cash needs. Yields a 3.4x MOIC by the end of the exercise. 
Line of Credit - 1M yearly. 2.68M Low water mark for cash needs. Balance of 2.68M is fully repaid by the end of the exercise while having generated $845k in interests over the duration of the exercise. 
With this we would strongly recommend the investment route as the most lucrative option. This is due to the much greater potential ROI but also because of the direct ownership onto the assets that Ole could have as opposed to the loan route. 
There is another thing though… which came up from analyzing the credit line route but with production opportunities as opposed to development. We believe that there could be a lot of potential in exploring the use of a credit line against very strong collateral like production contracts with companies like Disney and Tax Credits from government entities like state-level film commissions. But we should go over this part together so I can explain.
We ran an exercise with this assumptions and a $6M credit line for production contracts
