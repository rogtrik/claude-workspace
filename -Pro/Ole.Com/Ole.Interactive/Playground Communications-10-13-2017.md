PLAYGROUND MEDIA
There is an affinity between us and what the brand is doing. Compared to Vice, which was met with concern regarding their editorial line, Playground has been liked or at least accepted by our team. There is clear experience that we can bring to them in areas of International dealmaking. Exceptional in Latin America but also from a global standpoint given the scale of our partners and complexity of our region. Our JVs from what I understand are the leading revenue generators for each of our partners’ international media ventures. 
There is also seemingly an affinity in criteria. In that things that they have shown us proud of what they are presenting are well received by Olé as well as the teams that they have interacted with in VC Multichannel and their clients.
The worry of losing the audience that keeps us cold on Playground is currently happening in our other businesses. They on the other hand have a growing global audience 
The factory exists. It is in Barcelona. The brand guidelines and audience positioning of verticals are there. The volume of content and audience base to leverage for expansion is there.
The key to expansion for Playground Media is not to repeat the factory. It is to create carefully curated, geo targeted feeds based on cultural categories or market revenue. 
You keep HQ as such and in the case of Latin America you could start like it is proposed currently in the business plan with Mexico, Brasil, Argentina and Colombia. We have offices in all these countries as they are historically the leading creative and cultural influencers of the continent. They are also the largest ad markets and subscription entertainment revenue generators hence our presence there already.
Create feeds for each of those countries|subcultures and place a regional chief editor for that feed. With resources and a budget to create pieces that are most relevant for their feed but worthy of being in all feeds. A good journalistic|editorial producer can handle freelance crews efficiently until volume justifies actual headcount. Post can be done in HQ. This begins to truly create local editorial voices that understand the global perspective and reach through their strong connection to HQ. It can be repeated in other regions like they have already started to do.
This chief editor will have a two person accounts/creative team that focus mainly and report up to PlaygroundStudio.
PLAYGROUND STUDIO
This kind of agency together with AI driven consumer targeting as well as ad blocker bypassing are the future|present of the ad industry. Playground Studio has proven their capacity thus far and VCM and Ole Channels will provide a test bed to the potential exportation of that creative style.
PLAYGROUND DO 
is immediately a global project and we should appreciate the opportunity of being part of something like this. IF it is as real and altruistic as it sounds.
PLAYGROUND AI
This is one of the most important and growing fields of the coming decades. This is already at play in our industry with content discovery as well as consumer targeting and interaction. If this is real it makes the investment very different.

     **Due Diligence & Investment Strategy**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Due diligence is necessary to understand their operation more fully.  We should attempt to find efficiencies in what seems to be too large of a workforce for the current output. To counteract their most glaring weakness Playground Media must expand effectively to all social media and successfully manage their partner network. Their underperformance on Instagram as a company owned by Facebook who are their closest current media partner is not justified.
Invest in Series A with slightly larger amount than max losses in JV Biz Plan. Continue expanding alliances with VCM and Ole Channels. Use that cash to buy into the company pushing their total series A from 3.2M to 5M and a pool of 10% of total but with protections that surely the other series A members will appreciate. Additionally include opportunities for this group or its members to increase their participation. As partners and board members propose immediate expansion to Americas as well as other regions within a global expansion plan using the previously mentioned lower cost structures while eliminating conflicts of interest engaging with our large media partners by presenting a unified front.
