Lifetime started getting good stuff march 2016

18 month run + 2 month hiatus

28 is great moving fwd bu decided by partners.

ATP is an issue for these films… in Argentina it is a problem. But there is not the capacity 

Some are not relevant in our territories.

All 28 are not necessarily wanted… They are happy with the quantity not necessarily.

Next year quota does not need to be 28 it can be less.

Delivery is an issue
Beaches /// becomes impossible to do day and date /// dub faster or deliver sooner.
