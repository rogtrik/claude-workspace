# A+E Content Committee





GENERAL

2016 FR price per hour for A&E and THC is $20,750; for Lifetime it’s $13,720 and for H2 it’s $7,901; for re-runs, the price is 50% of the FR price.b

Clear difference on how productions are financed. Global perspective. Much more along the lines of Netflix and the big players seem to be aligning.

**General**

If we align with US we are at the hope that they will be able to elevate the brands over time to have a premium perception and value when included in OTT bundles. If not revenue for the venture and the partners will be hindered considerably.

Follow up with International Co-Pro incentive.

**A&E**


Very bad performance. Should follow US direction and eliminate drama. Try to get CI and Vice content to supercharge A+E. Bring it back to flagship brand status within its stronger position. Original production of formats is also worthy of jumpstarting again.

How can we have 3 of the top 10 US Shows and perform like we are?

**History**

It has been hard for all factual. Everywhere.
Very Bad for history. 

All shows eroding fast.

Original production? At least car formats.

**Lifetime**

Growth gone. Go factual to go efficient. 

Strengthen with FYI content.

Original Production?








# **October 2016 Sao Paulo**

**Ole** ENC / Juan / Abascal
**A+E** Edward / Laura / Tom 

New format... no more reviewing what most already should know but instead focused on discussion items and open conversation about programming and brands moving forward.

**A&E** Mood video was same as MIPCOM same worries were raised and Int share them. Coletti perspective is very interesting but he is still worried that it is still impossible to synthesize the essence of the brand. 

**History**
Humanity's infinite storybook / Life's Explorers.

Rebranding for History.... first pass is Nov 30 full switch on all platforms by January. 

**The Partner** needs to be licensed along with formats related to partner and profit. 

El Chapo & Sean Penn... what happened in Argentina.






**A&E Discussion Points**

Crime
Not being able to select from all buckets is completely counter-intuitive to Linear support and complete design of digital future. 

**History Performance Update**
Dropped in all territories except Brasil.

Sunday drop is most telling given the solid performance we have seen there historically with Pawn Stars.

Add New Viewers brought to network as metric to analyze programs. 

Think beyond the live rating.... +7 etc.
We need new KPIs to define success. This live rating and mc9 obsession is what lead to the decimation of the venture's OP efforts. Went from pioneers to small player in the field.

**September 15 2016 / History Vault Call**

How is vault working in the US?
What is the plan for original/exclusive content on Vault?

Where are we now with the H2 hours issue?

What other words can we use to replace vault that have a similar meaning.


## April 2016 Buenos Aires

There were evident communication issues that became evident during the discussion of the video database system as well as when the discussion came up on how to create the VOD packages for the MSOs. There should be meetings prior to the committees in which the management team gets on the same page before presenting to the partners. Also ALL the management team is presenting. If the top execs are not on board or have not seen what is being presented it distorts the discussion.


## **Opening Remarks**
User Centric Company concept is clearly the new management concept. 

Why are we still at the mercy of what the MSOs want to do or when they want to update their technologies while at the same time building their own advanced solutions for their users that will combine content from their current partners but mixed with digital brands like Netflix. On top of all this they are negotiating directly with the studios and content producers effectively eliminating the need for sub brands within their system… an MSO operated/owned Netflix if you will.

They are asking for many things and offering very little. This with the reality that what they paid the networks in the last two decades has been almost unchanged. 

The mentality of using other touch points to drive audiences back to cable is illogical. How much have new generations gone back to newspapers, magazines, radio?

If we do not change our perspective to a global brand together with our partners we do not stand a chance against the competition. 

There is NO clarity or unified vision on what is happening on this new shift towards VOD and expanded rights.

Coletti’s presentation was good. 

 
## Lifetime

Jane lost steam in 2016… why was it aired split with year-end?

Distribution is still an issue… focus is on HD feeds as solution. Clearly the market is very saturated. 4 year cycle for contract renewals to happen that will include Lifetime in the HBO basic channel pack.

Xmas movie situation limited to a specific territory? Southern hemisphere is thinking about end of school year and going to the beach… not chestnuts roasting on the open fire. 

Front of the wall stunts cannot be done given licensing limitations… Edward says that exceptions can be made.


## US UPDATE

History management change seems to be showing in the content shared in the presentation. Definitely back to basics and focused on what works.

Pipeline looks interesting for all networks. Looking forward to seeing more at IC



## Original Production

Focus on AdSales driven production is excellent. Would like to see how it actually becomes a reality beyond what has been done before. 

Regarding the perspective of opening up to new partnerships it is a necessity given the high cost of production needed for maintaining the quality when compared with the US product. We need to be wary of who we partner with. 

Hyper localized development should be more of a priority.

The way all original productions are presented for approval must be standardized. Use PAC type ROI form or come up with a new system that includes all details regarding story/concept, prod company/creative talent involved, total production budget, investment type (license, right ownership) what are we getting, who are we sharing it with, what are we giving and what are the expectations of the return associated with the project, both economically and in press, branding etc.

Guia Incorrecta, Os Bravos, Redes Sociales looks great

Historia Secreta, History Drone, Accelerators, Na Trilha do Mito is looking pretty good. 


## 
History

Erosion is strong. Leadership position is at play.

Promos are mostly hard to understand. This applies not only to History.

H2 performance among History heavy viewers is troubling. Look into it.

Very happy with localized per feed scheduling. This was an advantage our competitors had on us. Let’s see how they take advantage of this new capability.

Look into the whole change to a global history fan page… what was the benefit we were expecting? The loss is clear.

TedX alliance seems promising and is a good addition to the emprendedores concept. 

Escobar OP/… 6 hours??


## H2

Situation w/ reruns being charged as first run is not acceptable. On top of that we are in a situation that will potentially impact our distribution once the MSOs realize that was promised to them regarding premieres and content that is different and new from History is no longer true.

Schools are using H2 as part of their curriculum. Great promotional opportunity to bring a new younger audience that can become fans of the brand… maybe refocus the bran more in this direction especially online a la khan academy and such.


## **Operations and Distribution** 

Since our partner owns and controls the content that is most of what we show in LatAm we are technically in a position to offer much more than our competitors with the exception of Warner. This volume and quality of content with such flexible rights would potentially present more of a fee per brand. This would be under the concept of seeing where everyone stands with phase 1 and 2 but then hold under our sleeves a potential phase 3. 

We need to work with the MSOs and give them whatever they want and more… creating a habit with the audience of functionality more along the lines of what is available in the US. All this while developing the technological side of how the content is delivered at the rhythm and focus of a Netflix or any other OTT that does not have another option. Once the habit is created not only in consumption but also in payment the move to a Digital Bundle could be much smoother.

Runs situation continues w A+E. They are in a position of thinking how generous they are and the special treatment that we get and it is simply not the case when compared with all the other major content providers.

SERIOUS op issue with A+E regarding program deliveries and processes… this is having a huge impact on our operation and in the results that are being achieved. The management does not feel that they can be held accountable for performance if these problems are not fixed. 

Get even more dedicated feeds in exchange for the phase 2 level content.

## A&E

All network ratings drop in Argentina. Why?

Reasoning for the ratings issue between Argentina and Colombia in the case of A&E is a supposed explanation that when you cater to one you hurt the other. Drop in Argentina worse than gain in Colombia.

## Aug 2015 Bueno Aires

TVE must go to HTML5 compatibility. No proprietary.

The bringing up of a supposed impact in the ad sales performance for a programming is negligible both taking into account what the AdSales money represents in the total business as well as the lack of reliability when AdSales claims are made and programming adheres to it and Ad Sales almost always does not deliver on goals.

Dubbing quality seems to be even worse than before. Analyze where the problem lies either channel or dubbing company and then push for an increase in perceived quality. Will the audience even notice?

The deal for the jesuit is covering 60% of the total budget in exchange for LatAm all media rights. 360,000USD / 

Sugestiones looked great and format was appealing to Sally. 

Where are the ROI forms? Request at board level for all Original Productions as well as extraordinary acquisitions. Provide new structure on how original productions should be presented not only showing our investment but what that represents exactly inside of the total project. 

Drone footage can become excellent stock footage.

Unsurprising focus on Panama for original production advertainment.

Start adding marketing spend to acquisition on original production total spend numbers.

Additionally marketing initiatives should have their cost included in these presentations.

H2 has become an issue given the use of those catalog hours on History. In addition to that domestic has cut back and refocused their strategy regarding H2. The temporary uncertainty with the brand domestically should be compensated somehow so as to maintain affiliate, audience and company expectations.








## Feb 2015 Sao Paulo

Exacerbating Brasil on air situation 

Sundays are still being avoided 

Nonexistent OP strategy 

Brasil strategy is too focused on getting easy numbers. It is like fasting... All the weight will come back just as the p24 audience will leave. 

It is like november never happened... I recall as agreed... 
* NO Music
* Phase out Movies by end of year
* Focus on quality not quantity regarding series and minis
* Focus cash on securing A&E domestic scripted series.
They need mini series desperately! 

Switch to Lifetime is a go

Not skew too female… could plateau the general growth 

Bio could survive as a digital only platform and LatAm Team could reach a deal to translate/curate the site for both LatAm and US Hispanic. 

"Not step on each other toes” is not an established practice… this destroys x-promo intention.
