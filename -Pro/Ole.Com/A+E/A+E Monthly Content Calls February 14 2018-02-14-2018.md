History
Liz is on and leading the call. Corporate reshuffling and they referenced a new boss.
Hernan performed great. Second best scripted premiere ever. Triple digit over PT avg. Second episode even higher ratings. H ranked #2 / #3 most targets and 
Second season renewal immediately.
Production starts in less than a month. Azteca is on board. Amazon not yet.
Next week board meeting decision for next season. If the results and deal terms hold we should approve this swiftly.
Advertising revenue is a huge worry.

 
H2 is the elephant in the room. Does it make sense to keep it on life support if we do not see growth prospects in the market?
CSM and Monthly calls need to include costs and economics that were previously avoided in these conversations. This information is essential for effective decision making in these matters even at the cost of decreasing the amount of people that participate.
Ratings should be the metric of all linear research efforts as it is the standard and defines rankings. Only addition would be impressions so as to have a translatable metric to compare with digital performance. 
Share should be removed from these reports and conversations as they distort the reality of our performance.
