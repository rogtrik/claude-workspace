Forged keeps going. They are pusshing as the ratings sustainer. Combined with global effort to have a world championship shows clear support. Have looked in to developing this?

Pawn Stars will get more ep's and they will be dialing back the story content and focus back on the objects and info.

For Pickers they are into Episode refreshing making Best of Episodes and adding graphics and other elements. They are rating better. Are we getting access to these modified ep's?

EPISODE REFRESHING
They are not only impossible to language because of how they are edited but they are being sold to us as a new episode. This will increase languaging costs which should be leveraged against license cost. Should be treated as RR hour at the most.
