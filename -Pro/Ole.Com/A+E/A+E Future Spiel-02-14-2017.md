A+E Future Spiel

We see the long play in creating value in our content. And the true value generator IS the fact that they air on a US network. Now the premium play taking the core brands to SVOD and A+E's content through the new Studios elevate the offering to a Studio level. That commands a price in the market but A+E is a new player at this. If we play our cards right by designing a complete multi window SVOD strategy for the catalog and the content is good we will get to those levels in LatAm. It is a matter of time. So we WILL get to levels in which it makes sense to pay Major Studio Content prices for comparatively performing A+E Studios content but it is in everyone's best interest that the value is also created at the LatAm networks and it's exclusive SVOD content. If A+E Studios is actually able to make content that delivers at those levels and provides it's own networks subsidized access to it then it creates a clear competitive edge and places it among the other premium players that have a mix of exclusive and non exclusive content. But if we try to maximize licensing revenue on the content the networks themselves lose their competitive edge providing less value to that same content .
