# A+E Board of Directors




# Board Q3 2024

H2 drop is considerable. Let’s track that drop since the peaks that Vikings gave and try and quantify how much it helped in share of audience, how much it helps now, and potentially how much revenue potential was lost versus the savings generated. 

OD needs to align on strategy and market realities. We can’t make a case to A+E to give us SVOD and FAST products when they keep playing up how meaningless or lack of interest there is.

Sato settlement and new Intelsat agreements were approved.

Design a VOD Proposal with A+E Team. We need to follow up with Patrick and we have the long pending meeting with Mark to understand their existing offering and strategies in other parts of the world. 






# Pre Meeting Q3 2024 August 13

Called up JC and Iturriaga to discuss the future of our products towards affiliates. 

They will share Sony’s latest FAST channel presentation, prepare a presentation showing the status of what all the other major players are doing in the market.
