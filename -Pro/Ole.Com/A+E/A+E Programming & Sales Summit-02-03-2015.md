Analyze copro model and its effectivity. Creative input seems almost nonexistent and the parameters taken into account should be anyway since they are sold internationally later. So are we just playing financiers?

We need to stop getting creative with our acquisitions out of partner network. It is a strange panorama when all their best dramas are on other networks in our territories.

Stop looking at ourselves and thinking that horizontal/vertical etc will fix our scheduling. Consistency and true awareness of demo flow in cable based on really analyzing the competition.

Build the nights one by one and bend the rules to truly grow the night.

If Premium no longer means rated R or high budget production then the lines finally blurred and there is no clear distinction. It is true quality and perceived value of partaking in the program, experience, society that justifies premium. So if the lowering of the barriers of entry from the HBO perspective puts it on the defensive/offensive in the case of all others if it is seen under the right light is a great opportunity to shift and become a Premium brand. In the now it is more about how you are perceived.

**Setting goals and Measuring Success **

It all comes back to adSales

Upfront Season based on guaranteeing client access to highest reaching programs.
Whole year schedule planned in advance in programming department.
Handed over to program research.
Quarterly avgs for the last 3 to 4 years based on day parts. Returning series with their corresponding trends. Project behavior based on subjectivities like returning cast member on a spinoff. 
For new shows comparables are used to estimate a potential performance.
Repeat performance. 25 premiere 75 repeat
Estimates go to adsales ... One day goes to Live + 3 but called C3 which focuses on ratings for the actual commercial breaks. Overall C3 becomes the metric for every single show.
It all goes once again to adsales... c3 are used to estimate weeks, months, quarters. And that using inventory creates a true commercial capacity number. Numbers are crossed with CPM rates to gauge max commercial potential. Ratings estimates are guaranteed to client.
Once revenue potential is calculated then that locks in programming budget. If it is lower then prog has less for product which leads to lower ratings and sales goals are not met.
Lots of constant course correction. 
Development and AdSales are closer than ever. All routes of revenue potential must be looked at.
Creating sponsor-able ancillary content.
Best way to set realistic goals is for all moving parts to truly communicate effectively and not give up on the discussion until an "agreement" is reached. It cannot happen that anyone leaves the meeting thinking that it is unattainable.
Dynamic ad insertion. Can it be done in linear?
Completely different game in less than 5 years.
DMP . Digital Management Platform / used for dynamic ad insertion in digital.
Partnered with key player in field to develop for Linear platform.
5-7% Drop in cable.

Ideal is one to one to use each returning to launch the new ones.

Last couple of years has been 2 to 1 given the recent success

Franchises as lead-ins
Not necessarily and it create a counterproductive dependency

Successful Series / Moving Time Slots
DONT

Launch upon launches are effective.., create a heightened attention on the network and a feeling of general freshness. Also a special window of moving audiences between shows. Opposite to general assumption the audience does snowball.

Repeats are down across the board. Industrywide.
Recently avoided as much as possible but financial model does not allow it. Repeats are required given sales commitments and deficit amortization.

When to quit?
Case by case but what are you going to replace it with.

Competition
Mimic or counter program
Mainly counter. Search for the white space and windows of opportunity. 

Looking at shows more than networks but...

History
Discovery
NatGeo
Science
Top 5 / Top 10

A&E
ESPN
TNT
USA
FX
Broadcast

Lifetime
AMC
TNT
FX
HBO

VH1
Oxygen
bet
OWN
TLC
E!

So hence the show that is being scheduled must be looked at in relation to its corresponding competitors.

Daytime Scheduling / Stripping vs Stacking
Lifetime... Stripped off net shows. As it gets close to prime there is a switch to stacking.
History... All stacking
