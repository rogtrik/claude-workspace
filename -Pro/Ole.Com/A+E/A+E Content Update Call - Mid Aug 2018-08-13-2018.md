     They are selling History’s main shows to free TV buyers. Chile case in particular is very strong. 
Why are the shows getting shorter??? Is there a minimum duration in the PLA? Is it always met? Is there a mechanism to employ when it is not the case?
40-41min as opposed to the 44min standard. 
How is this complicated or a can of worms? Licensing fees should be pro rated by minute then. 
Snap-ins licensing terms?
Travis Pastrana Transmedia experiment is great. 
Sep 17 Evel Live… kickoff to the week. 
Cost/Result of Drama is an issue for History. AdSales is not commercializing Drama. Brand exposure, premium image, but ratings and ROI they are the most challenging genre for History today.
