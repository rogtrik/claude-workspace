     #OleCom
I really want to make this happen but you are not making it easy with regards to this negotiation. Your proposal which we discussed with Frank and we recommended against going and discussing it with Enrique. You did and the reaction was like we expected. I shared your email with both of them and received even stronger pushback. 
We very much value what you bring to this business and like I have shared with you it is an area of increasing importance to Ole. So with the intention of trying to make this happen I took a crack at bending your proposal into something that might be agreeable to us. 
Now before even delving into this what I need to understand is if you are open to considering such a change from what you proposed and what in the end is your endgame here.
We have discussed before and when talking about a smaller equity stake (20!!) you mentioned you would rather be just a board member and many times you have talked about your angle being to create value in order to sell off at some later time. 
How much of this is true and how are you envisioning this timeline for your eventual selloff?
Starting with the 
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *financial commitment*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      of the deal and the business itself you proposed:
3 Year Overhead Expenses Commitment capped at $3.75M
We can agree to this but not all costs will be paid through NewCo, and many functions of the company will be handled through services to be provided by our related companies. 

Then you proposed
$4M Equity investment for the acquisition of first LatAm Co. 
We at the moment do not consider the acquisition of a company to be in the near future for this plan. We propose designing the parameters upon which an acquisition would trigger, be it a LatAm or US based company and if those are met then we can agree in having the possibility of making equity investments capped at $4M


 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *Equity Split*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
Moving on to the equity split we reach our first impasse. 
You proposed that the Equity Split in NewCo should be 50/50 which we can agree to but only if limited to NewCo and not inclusive of equity within any acquisition made by us unless we agree to do so at that juncture under financing terms to be negotiated at that time which should be in line with the financing terms agreed upon for the initial commitment. 
We are not seeing the same numbers that you are seeing and could be made to see otherwise as the analysis continues but at the time we have clear and very high thresholds upon which we consider it ideal to trigger an acquisition. 
We can agree to the vesting terms but they trigger at the end of each year so economic impact would be delayed a year. 
16% December Y1, effective towards Y2 profits if any
33% December Y2 effective towards Y3 profits if any
50% December Y3 effective towards Y4 profits if any. 
In addition to changing the term and how it triggers we would also set revenue and profit goals based on mutually agreed upon budgets and if they are not met then the share will not vest. Y1 would be the first year the goals are achieved even if it happens on Y3.


 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *Control*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
Operating control will be shared equally but tiebreaker will be settled but equity stake. Once all shares have vested and we are at a 50/50 a tie breaking mechanism must be defined and agreed upon by the partners. 


 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *Investment Recoupment*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
Ole to receive 100% of NewCo profit distributions until it has fully recouped plus an additional yearly 20% premium on the investment applicable to the beginning of any years pending balance in addition to any portion not covered by the partners in cash for the upcoming years budget. 


 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *NewCo Board Membership*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
Each of Sabin and Ole will appoint 3 board members. Voting rights will be as expressed in the control section. 


 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *Sabin Employment Agreement*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
In order to justify the 50% ownership you will be having in this company within 3 years we see the salary or any direct compensation to you as your investment. So we would propose to not have any base salary. 
We would instead propose 5% of all gross revenue generated by NewCo in place of a salary. This would mean:
LOW // 120k / 250k / 400k
MID // 170k / 440k / 728k
HI // 485k / 848k / 1.3M
————————
16/33/50
LOW //  120k / 780k / 2M
MID // 300k / 2.1M / 5M
HI // 1.43M / 4.6M / 10M

Contract will be yearly renewable automatically upon meeting low scenario or as decided mutually by the partners.
Sabin’s services will be full time, non material interference basis and no other pursuit of Sabin’s may conflict with the business of NewCo

I believe this way we can start immediately and not have to wait for any further analysis and instead do it as we are already operating and producing.

     #OleCom
Had a good talk with Frank on Friday after an update on the intel gathering with Ari and I think we need to redesign our plan as it seems I was the one putting the cart before the horse.
Ole’s current position is that they indeed do have interest in content production when focused on using Latin American talent and production resources. Additionally if this can become an opportunity for our channel ventures or our partners in those ventures then it becomes even more interesting.
I have been tasked with exploring specific opportunities that can help us grow the content side of our business including this one. 
Understanding my function within all this more clearly I believe our plan should be as follows:

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * Focus the work and upcoming meeting in Miami around how Edward Sabin is the perfect person to partner with to make this project a reality.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Access to key executives and effective generation volume deals.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Access to financing sources for other content endeavors.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Provide leadership for this new company coming from a formidable background at several of the largest media companies in the world.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * Meet to discuss your vision for this venture and how we could potentially partner.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Personal expectation with regards to equity or any other aspect outside employment.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Commitment if we proceed to stay in the role of CEO full time for at least 3 years.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Discuss exit expectations.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * Continue gathering intel to build out initial business plan.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * Acquisition target analysis of several opportunities in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Brasil.
