# Intel Rush for NBCU Negotiation


SOA

AMC vs NBCU

Comparison of brands, reach, distribution, SOI advertising


AMC vs NBCU + Sony + A+E


OD represents the 3rd largest group in the business and one of the few true experts in the market with nearly 40 years of experience in the market. 
	Top team
		EX Head of Distribution of FOX, ex CEO of Turne, ex CEO of HBO
	Managing 600+ affiliate relationships



The value of NBCU buoyed by the channel group and OD


U+ success is possible because of all these existing structures and relationships.


We are clearly not looking at the same company here


UNISLA is a company that has a considerable precedent and track record. If we are going to compare it with anything else it should be WBD or Disney not some small player like AMC and within that comparison we believe that UNISLA has greater profit margins than either of those two. 


UNISLA has 40% margins that have grown since we partnered and still has a brilliant future.


We have been in the channel distribution business for nearly 40 years now… which we were a part of creating. We have extraordinary relationships with ALL the cable operators in the market including the largest companies and the countless smaller 


We entered UNISLA with your invitation to go in and purchase the Time Warner piece and at that time the focus was on the Cash Flow multiple and we should do the same now.


There is a clear conflict of interest in how UNISLA executive team has used the existing linear business to migrate “value” over to the nascent U+ business and created distortions like in the case of DirecTV that really do not reflect the truth but instead reflects the hope towards the future of that executive team. 

The deterioration of the Pay TV business in LatAm is not following the same patterns as in the US

The growth that UNISLA has enjoyed has been thanks to the work done by OD and its team.

Remember who we are… the track record, experience

We don’t see the rationale when comparing with AMC. It is simply incorrect.

When we bought into UNISLA, 




Your attitude is what is impacting the relationship with Sony, the potential is there to maintain the unified front towards the changes in the industry and best maximize the value of all our businesses.
