Episode 3 - Mr Goldman, Mr Sex

- Fabian Thylmann, the "king of world porn", had his porn empire Manwin taken over by a mysterious buyer named Bernard Bergemar (later revealed to be Bernd Bergmair).
- Bergmair, a former Goldman Sachs banker, secretly bought Manwin after Fabian was arrested for suspected tax evasion, taking advantage of Fabian's troubles.
- Bergmair was able to keep his identity hidden for nearly a decade, using a fake name and staying out of the public eye, despite becoming the owner of the world's largest porn company.
- Bergmair had no prior experience in the porn industry, but was able to take over and expand the business, in part by hiring young tech-savvy people like the Picquet twins to help run the sites.
- The tube site model pioneered by Bergmair's RedTube site, which gave away porn videos for free, disrupted the traditional porn industry and led to tensions with other porn producers.
- Bergmair took a hands-off, passive approach to running the porn empire, focused solely on maximizing profits rather than engaging with the day-to-day operations or controversies.
- The lack of content moderation and oversight on Bergmair's porn sites would eventually lead to major scandals and backlash against the industry.
- Fabian Thylmann believes Bergmair's complacency and unwillingness to engage with the industry's problems contributed to the eventual downfall of the porn empire.
- The rise of free tube sites like Bergmair's disrupted the traditional porn industry, raising questions about piracy, content moderation, and the ethics of the industry.
- The story highlights the secrecy, power dynamics, and lack of accountability that characterized the online porn industry during its rapid growth in the 2000s.

Episode 4 - The billionaire who took down porn

- Bill Ackman, a prominent billionaire investor, played a key role in pressuring payment companies like Mastercard and Visa to cut off services to the porn company MindGeek, which owns Pornhub.
- Mastercard and Visa effectively act as de facto regulators of the porn industry, setting rules and guidelines on the types of content that can be monetized through their payment systems.
- Payment processors like MobiusPay have detailed lists of prohibited words, acts, and themes that they enforce on behalf of Mastercard and Visa to protect the card networks' brand reputations.
- This system of content moderation and control by payment companies creates a form of "self-censorship" in the porn industry, as performers and producers have to adhere to these rules to be able to accept credit card payments.
- The rules set by Mastercard and Visa evolve over time, with some previously banned content becoming acceptable, demonstrating the fluid and arbitrary nature of this private regulation.
- Porn performers like Stoya expressed frustration at not being able to depict natural bodily functions like menstruation, which are deemed unacceptable by the payment companies.
- The power wielded by Mastercard and Visa over the porn industry is described as "more power than the Pope", as they effectively dictate the boundaries of what can be produced and distributed.
- The lack of transparency around the decision-making process and specific rules set by the payment companies creates a sense of confusion and uncertainty for those working in the adult industry.
- The crackdown by Mastercard and Visa on MindGeek led to the removal of millions of videos from Pornhub, representing one of the largest takedowns of online content in history.
- The porn industry's reliance on major payment processors highlights how private companies can exert significant control and influence over the availability of online content, even in legal but stigmatized industries.

Episode 5 - Knocking on the door of a porn empire

- WGCZ, the owner of popular porn sites like XVideos and XNXX, is a much larger and more secretive company than its rival MindGeek.
- WGCZ is run by the Pacaud twins, Stephane and Malorie, who have managed to avoid public scrutiny despite operating a massive porn empire.
- WGCZ's headquarters in Prague are located in an unassuming building, where the company even produces some of its most extreme "humiliation porn" content.
- Performer Sabien DeMonia describes the intense physical and mental strain that comes with shooting content for WGCZ's production studios.
- WGCZ has found a way to bypass many of the content restrictions imposed by payment processors like Visa and Mastercard by operating its own in-house payment processor.
- This payment processor independence gives WGCZ greater flexibility to host and monetize more extreme and niche pornographic content.
- While MindGeek faced a crackdown from payment companies, WGCZ has managed to largely avoid similar scrutiny by staying under the radar.
- The Pacaud twins, especially Stephane, are described as secretive, controlling, and micromanaging in their approach to running the WGCZ empire.
- WGCZ's success highlights how financial infrastructure and payment processing can be a key factor in the porn industry's power dynamics.
- The document suggests WGCZ's business model and content practices push the boundaries of what is acceptable, even if technically legal, within the porn industry.

Episode 6 - How OnlyFans changed porn

- OnlyFans was a platform that significantly shifted power and money back to porn performers, allowing them to earn much more directly from their content.
- The origins of OnlyFans can be traced back to the fetish of "financial domination", where performers would script scenarios for fans to pay them.
- OnlyFans was founded by the Stokely family, an unlikely group of "porn barons" - Tim Stokely had the idea, while his father Guy Stokely provided the initial funding.
- The Stokelys sold OnlyFans in 2018 to Ukrainian-American businessman Leo Radvinsky, who had experience in the porn industry and payment processing.
- OnlyFans' decision to ban porn in 2021 was driven by difficulties with payment processors and banks, not a strategic move by the company.
- The Stokelys left OnlyFans shortly after this incident, likely because Radvinsky, the new owner, wanted to steer the platform more towards mainstream content.
- OnlyFans' reliance on external payment processors and banks, who are often wary of adult content, is a key vulnerability in the platform's business model.
- Performers like Peppermint and Dusty felt a lack of trust in OnlyFans after the flip-flop on banning porn, concerned it could happen again.
- The power in the porn industry ultimately lies with the payment systems and financial institutions, not the platforms or performers themselves.
- The story of OnlyFans highlights the complex and often fraught relationship between the porn industry and the mainstream financial world.

Episode 7 - Inside porn’s star chamber

- Payment companies like Visa and Mastercard have become the de facto regulators of the porn industry, wielding significant power over what content can be produced and distributed.
- Performers like Allie Knox have had their income streams disrupted when payment companies banned certain types of content, like videos of them using drugs, even though the content was legal.
- Visa and Mastercard developed an internal "star chamber" system for making decisions about what content violates their policies, often based on vague "brand protection" rules.
- The payment companies did not want this role of policing porn content, but took it on out of necessity to address fraud and illegal content like child abuse imagery.
- Visa and Mastercard's regulations and decisions have a major impact on the livelihoods of porn performers, sometimes in arbitrary or inconsistent ways.
- There is no clear alternative to Visa and Mastercard's role as the dominant payment processors for the porn industry, as other options like cryptocurrencies remain impractical.
- Performers feel that Visa and Mastercard are making moral judgments that should be the domain of governments and the public, not private companies.
- The payment companies' policies are designed to protect their brands, not necessarily to benefit performers or consumers.
- Attempts to reach the secretive owners of major porn companies like MindGeek were unsuccessful, highlighting their elusiveness.
- The porn industry has undergone massive changes with the rise of platforms like OnlyFans, but payment processors still wield significant control over the business.
