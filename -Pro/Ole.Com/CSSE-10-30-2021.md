	Phil Oppenheim - SCP Program Scheduling at Epix (new addition?)

REDBOX - TVOD - FAST - AVOD

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * How does the traffic split between these categories?

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     	* Within FAST how is the split between FAST and AVOD within Redbox

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * Will redbox+ evolve somehow or stay limited to kiosk benefits?

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * What is redbox unscripted? promo news relate dot the product?

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     * Was surprised to see such a low review count on the TVOD titles. Is that representative of usage?

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
Crackle - Crackle Plus ?
Popcornflix
Chicken Soup for the Soul
Still these brands? How does the traffic compare among them? Is there an intention to consolidate?

We know our markets and have vast experience in other types of media and content distribution. We can apply assumptions and user acquisitions costs as well as CPMs per territory off the data we see from our digital media businesses but none of these are actual SVOD or FAST properties and to better develop a business plan we would need to count on the data you guys are seeing from the US and elsewhere to make basic initial assumptions that will evolve over time but that should be representative of audience behavior as close as possible to what we will see on a same category project. 

Content Performance and User Behavior
Active Content Inventory on each of the above. How many titles total. Split between in house and 3rd party on each.
Elan mentioned a lot of organic user acq is this still the case?
Marketing focus or split of budget among brands?
User acquisition costs
MAU of each platform (50k threshold towards platform for inventory split real?)
ATS and Retention or Total time viewing
Avg Minutes per user
Page Views
Total Ad IMpressions
Fill rate for each platform

     **Reset Call - Ole CSSE on Apr 6, 2023**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     New term sheet prepared by Ole was presented to Elana and she said that she would be able to get Bill to sign next day and that we would be able to get back to work after the holiday weekend.
Off a fully executed term sheet the plan would be to reduce margin of error of latest business plan projection thanks to greater access to CSSE data. The idea would be that we get to work immediately on the distribution front while we bring technical and content up to speed.
Trip to NY is postponed until further notice and when we are actually ready for that meeting to happen.

     **Bill & Enrique Call - CSSE x Ole on March 7, 2023**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Ole presented our proposal and plan for Y1. Bill was “surprised” by what we shared and alleged he had not seen it. This was a missed opportunity and potentially could blow this up. We are expecting clearer feedback from CSSE in order to set an in person meeting in NY.

     **Call on Jun 1, 2022**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Daniela running this call. 
All feels very preliminary and superficial for a 9-month long discussion. 
Daniela proposed August as a target date to have everything clear in order to present internally. That is exactly 12 months after the conversations started. 
Whose AdStack to use is something to be defined. 
	There have been no conversations about tech matters.
Xiaomi proposed by Gus as a platform opportunity.
