Hi Evan. Just got to finally meet in person. Thanks for the candid vibes as always. Like I mentioned I would really appreciate the possibility of working with you in an advising capacity and it would be great to find a way to collaborate in Latin America. Our company was one of the pioneers of the Pay TV industry in the region with our partnerships with HBO, A+E and NBCUNIVERSAL and along with our distribution, advertising and content programming expertise we continue to co-own and operate these businesses having added localization services. Plenty to talk about here of course…

A few years ago now we doubled down in digital pureplay brands with Playground and #EsTrending generating about 300M+ video views a month and through some acquisitions have built out programmatic advertising and creative agency functions to strengthen our brands as well as offer services to other publishers. This is where I am trying ti steer the company and conversation.

Ecommerce and retail is something we are actively looking to invest and expand into and seeing how players like Mercado Libre are becoming players in the media space we believe we can effectively partner and have impact in that space.
