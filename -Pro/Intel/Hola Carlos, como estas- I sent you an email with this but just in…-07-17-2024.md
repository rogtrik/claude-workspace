Hola Carlos, como estas? I sent you an email with this but just in case, here's the same info:
	•	What Monzon should know about TA+ because of prior presentations:
	◦	Web based total audience solution
	◦	Automatically updates the data during overnight hours
	◦	It presents TV data as Kantar does or extrapolated
	◦	It offers a total number of impressions and a unique deduplicated audience reach of all platforms (on and off). The deduplication is based on a algorithm  
	◦	Heads of the department of Mathematics at the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) worked with our provider to develop the extrapolation and deduplication of the audiences
	◦	E&Y audited the security of the data
	•	Additional developments:
	◦	Campaign attribution using advertisers transactional data
	•	Additional tools included in TA+:
	◦	Offers a planning solution in which the team can input the campaign and calculates the results
	◦	Offers an optimizer solution in which you set goals and select the platforms and brands that you want to use, and the software gives you the most optimal campaign
	◦	Offers a dashboard for planners to track their portfolio, campaigns, etc
	•	Other info:
	◦	The CIM audited and validated the tool
	◦	Pending development of additional attribution models (e.g., using geo loc data, etc)
	•	How has A+E leveraged the tool:
	◦	Obtained over US$3M in new client business in 2022 and US$2M in 2022 in Mx alone
	◦	Retained over 10 clients that were looking for specific KPI delivery
	◦	Simplified planners job for campaign proposal and follow up delivery
Text me if anything, thank you!
