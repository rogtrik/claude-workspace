General
What have you done to evolve and improve your understanding of the position and the opportunity?
What have you done or plan to do to evolve and improve your capacity of performing at the highest level in this new position. 
Since the last FP BOD we have had 38 work days excluding holidays. If this was a 9am-5pm this represents 304hrs of work. If this is more important to you it could even represent around 380hrs. 
What have you done with the 380hrs that have been at your disposal? 
Although in all fairness since you are working for an American/Global company my reference point has always been in USD. If I do make the exercise to your local currency you are getting paid quite well assuming at least 304hrs in the last month. This does not even take into account the increases discussed for January 2019 that I no longer consider wise or even justified. 

Show me the work! Show me 380hrs of your time?
Walk me through a typical day in the life of Foton Pictures Chief Fin/Ops Officer?

Are we seeing things differently?

I see a complete lack of initiative and confidence in your on work. Laziness and a complete disregard to the needs and urgencies of the organization. What is happening? What are you doing?

Gaps are great and high level negotiation and strategy discussion are beneficial. The methods are inconsistent and achieved at the cost of causing friction within the organization. 
Operations is the entire organism. If any part of the organism drops the ball it cannot hit the floor.
