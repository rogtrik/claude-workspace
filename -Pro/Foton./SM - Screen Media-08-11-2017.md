Beside the continued commercialization of the film we have no real reason to stay with SM while at the same time I cant find any justifiable to leave the deal either.
Feelings will always be impacted in business and nothing that they have done so far has been in bad faith or ill intentioned. They were mistakes made like we all have and on all occasions immediately acknowledged and corrected them.
What have we done to get them excited about the project?
What have we done to collaborate on their sales strategy and communicate our specific expectations and priorities?
Disagreed on... 
Shadiness
Permission to proceed
No rolling over
