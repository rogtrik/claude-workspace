Why are they still trying to include the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum as part of corp docs - wouldn't this override that...?  If so, this document should make it clear that that is the case.

What exactly is the RDA Company Agreement?  Subscription agreement from SBP to RDA makes no sense (since it's the other way around) - it's really not that complicated - 2 subscription agreements:

1.  RDA Subscription Agreement
2.  Double R Subscription Agreement

Good faith efforts re: additional animation projects is reasonable - there is no trigger here for financing for additional projects and without having that I would probably take the same position.

Why did they capitalize "Subsequent" and erase the definition of "Animation Project(s)" - if they are going to erase the definition, then everything should be lower case.

I just think you need to paint a picture for them, especially given the liability issues that has come up for them previously.  If they default on this agreement then what are your remedies, what happens in case of inaction, etc., then who are you going to sue RDA and/or Double R - what assets do they have have - I would let them know that you have to justify the risk to the investors and so that it doesn't become about you.  Not sure if there is an insurance policy that would cover this kinda thing.  When a key man is involved in a deal, they need to sign an inducement - that's normal.  Especially when they are potentially a fellow member of the LLC.
