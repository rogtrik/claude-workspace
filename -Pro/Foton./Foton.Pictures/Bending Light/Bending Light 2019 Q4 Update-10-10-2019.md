Dear Partners

It has been too long since our last update and much has happened. 

Our first film, Sundance Dramatic Competition title, 
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *To The Stars*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      has been sold domestically by CAA to Samuel Goldwyn. The negotiation took longer than what would have been ideal but we were able to achieve the ever more rare US Theatrical release. Although the deal has a low MG we were able to negotiate some very favorable terms on the upside. The news of this distribution in the US should boost our international sales efforts and the recent announcement already has had an effect. 

In hindsight it seems it might been have wise to have made a smaller bet on

     *To The Stars*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      but we are still confident it will be a good investment in the long run. The movie has not even been released yet. Also, given that the cast is increasing in value,  the overwhelmingly positive critical reception and the quick payout of the Oklahoma tax incentive that puts us in a good position to keep recouping our investment after a successful US release.

     *Changing The Game*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      continues a successful festival run and UTA has some excellent buyers still at the table. Hulu, Apple and Barack Obama’s company are active and Netflix, which had passed a while back seems to be interested again. We have noticed a market that looks to be saturated with content about this subject matter. Not only LGBT but Trans specifically. This has made it harder to break through the noise but given the players currently in active conversations and the impact of this unique film we expect to make a good sale before the end of this year.

     *Here Are The Young Men*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     , our Irish project,  will finally be coming to market at the upcoming AFM in Los Angeles. The film has benefitted considerably from all the activity regarding our cast and is helping close a better deal with our sales agent. We will be screening the film next month at AFM and estimate we will begin making sales before the end of the year. Given our extremely advantageous position on this project we stand to make a great return on this investment.

     *Pink Skies Ahead*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      is our first project produced in 2019. We have some great partners in this project with considerable influence in the industry. Given the stature of our partners and the terms of our deal, we have positioned this investment as precedent for what we hope will be a now standard 30% premium on our equity deals which we were first able to achieve with our Irish project. The project is finished and has already been submitted for consideration for Sundance 2020. We are confident in our chances of getting selected but opposed to this past January, we are changing the strategy towards our agents and distributors. We believe it is more coherent how how the industry is behaving and it should be beneficial. We are in the closing stages of a co-rep deal between WME & CAA to sell the film at Sundance.

     *Echo Boomers*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     , our first action thriller is currently in editorial and the material is looking great. At a higher budget, the cast and production value let us delve into the genre realm and is part of our strategy in reaction to our first 3 projects. The project, very much like

     *Pink Skies Ahead*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     , will also be sold in a new way and although we will be submitting to Sundance as well, we believe it will be better served by premiering in SXSW getting to the festival having already engaged with a distributor.  Continuing with our efforts in improving our deal terms, this project was negotiated with a more than 40% premium on our equity investment. 


 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *Birthday Cake*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      could potentially be our first mafia movie if we reach a deal. It has great value and the sales projections are among the best we have seen. Some scenes have already been shot and the movie should be finished before the end of the year. We are currently in negotiations and are optimistic we can reach a good deal for Bending Light. 

Seeing the reception of our first three projects compared to our originally proposed projections it is safe to conclude that it is definitely cold out there. Thankfully we prepared for this within our investment strategy, are even more diversified than originally expected and are confident our initial investments will mostly be impacted in the rate of return. Additionally, these later investments are the result of updated business and content strategies and we believe they will perform more in line with our initially proposed projections. 

If we proceed with

     *Birthday Cake*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      it would be Bending Light’s 6th feature film and that would put us around the xx$ mark of funds executed out of our total 2.2M raised. Our estimates are that we should be able to execute xxx more investments with the remainder of the funds. 

The investments have take longer to deploy that originally expected but I believe it has given us a chance to be more selective with regards to which projects we want to bet on as well as which partners we would rather work with. This has also allowed us the chance pivot in the time between the different batches of projects and achieve a very tangible increase in project value together with our completely out of standard financial position in each project. 

Please reach out if any of you would like to attend any festival our films are playing as well as if you would like us to arrange a private screening for the films that are already finished.
