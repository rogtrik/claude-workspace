EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BENDING LIGHT

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

While Foton Pictures focuses on IP and Content ownership and generation Bending Light looks at things in a much more pragmatic and objective manner.

Foton Pictures will focus on producing international theatrical films. 
It will become renown for discovering and acquiring quality source material, developing and maintaining close relationships with the top artistic and creative talent. Originating, adapting and developing unique project packages combining prestigious quality storytelling with human level relatability.

Bending Light will focus on the financing side of the content business while collecting a premium-only, owned and controlled library. 

Bending Light Structure

Ownership should be 51% Foton.Pictures and 49% pool of investors. This would at least be regarding voting right in the other option of 20% Foton.Pictures and 80% pool of investors.

Right to veto on all in-threshold project. Never to the extent of impeding in a quick and effective negotiating process.

Right to approval on out-of-threshold projects. More flexible time limits but still with the intention of not impeding the negotiating process.

Threshold to be defined by specific ratios between the cash inflow waterfall relating to the minimum guarantees and the amount to be invested in that particular project. This varies depending on whether it is equity or debt.

     **Threshold = The investment must be recouped and minimum performance margins in profit just from the MG’s.**

All films are bonded creating the protection against the extreme low case scenario in film production. **

i.e. Debt position of 1M in budget of 2M with minimum guarantees of 1.5M given the first position of debt it would be in-threshold. Equity position of 1M in budget of 2M with minimum guarantees of 750k and depending on existing subordinations given the later equity recoupment schedule this proposal would be out of threshold.

Model for Debt deals in which we can input any loan amount and any budget range as well as parameters like term, interest and fees so that it always hits at least the expected 20% return offered to our investors on debt deals.

Based on this assumption I will run the previous model to create a type of business plan for BL. We need to define estimated fixed costs and management fee off money invested within the calendar year. Currently thinking 3% Fee and 20% Profit Participation for Foton Pictures as owner and managing partner. We will maintain voting control over the entity with very strong protections for our partners and the creation of a green-light committee for matters that are over the standard pre approved operating limits. i.e. Committee approval required for debt deals outside the return parameters or over the per project amount cap / Same applies to equity plays outside of the dev and prod investment caps.

Foton Pictures business plan. Based on the Bending Light's Business Plan model how Foton Pictures will benefit from its management fee, profit participation as well as other opportunities including admin/legal expense reimbursements, producer fees, finders fees charged to prod budget and back end points awarded through negotiation of debt deals that are above and beyond the expected return for BL.
