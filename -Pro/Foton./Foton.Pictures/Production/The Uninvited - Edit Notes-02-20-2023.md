     **Session with Nadia on Apr 25, 2023**

     Finally get a chance to talk. 
Was trying to remember and I think the only time this has happened before was when I walked you to your car one night during the shoot and one phone call towards the beginning with Patrick. 
Cheers and thank you for the time and the opportunity of joining you on this journey and for the trust in allowing us to collaborate with you in taking this film to the widest audience possible.
With the hope of having the time to give ourselves this opportunity finally I would love to hear more about you and what the journey was like from 25th hour to  Uninvited and how it became to be your narrative feature debut. 
How much of this story is personal to you?
What you have embarked upon is one of the hardest things I believe a creator and storyteller can do which is open their own heart and lives to the audience and baring it all to the benefit of the art and our craft. 
Where are you now with the cut compared to what you had envisioned when you wrote this thing… how many golden Nadia’s out of 10 being exactly how you imagined are currently achieving. 
The fact that it is such a high number notwithstanding all the limitations and complications that got us here is truly a great achievement. 
What is your perspective of the post process and what do you feel changed on switch over to Todd.
What has the dynamic and process been with Todd. 
During this entire process it has felt like there is only been one person speaking with a couple of words over the first weeks that were very quickly quieted. Later upon the switch to Todd it was like a new voice had joined the conversation. I believe gave us the gift of objectivity and a fresh perspective including pacing, structure and providing a clearer narrative focus and giving us permission to laugh at the tragic aspects of our story. 
The process of creation and editing are very different animals. Great authors do not achieve those levels without a great editor and the same could be said about the truly great filmmakers. 
We brought in Todd for a reason and I feel that he initially delivered but with more recent cuts even though they have progressed considerably in many aspects I also sense a kind of regression tonally that I think the film will truly shine with the difficult task of finding that sweet spot between these two “versions” if you will..


You must allow those around you to also their thing and add to the collaborative artform that this is. 
What is about to happen after you deliver your director’s cut as an absolutely natural part of the process. Even Coppola, Ridley Scott and many others have had director’s cut released many years later.

A clearer arc for Rose in which we see her doubting the choices that she has made in her life and getting a breath of what could have been to then be officially uninvited by Hollywood and the effect that that environment has had on her and Sammy. In the end she comes back to her core and stands strong as a mother and a woman.

     **3rd or 4th Todd Cut from Apr 24, 2023**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Helen space out moments and in general her storyline is confusing and unclear. Takes up way too much time given the little payoff it provides to the story while also taking away from the pace of things. 
Fables, particularly the one about the fishermen catching the fish also seem like particularly superfluous. 
I feel there was more of a comedic vibe and tone that has gone away since two cuts ago. 
“Pull Lucien out of school” line is still there when Rose and Sammy talk under the stairs. 
Very hard to see the real value of the 70 we just spent for the extra shoot day. Hope there is more coming. 
Sammy says her stage name is Helen Hale? Is that the same as the previous moment her stage name is mentioned?
The transition from the tension to the romantic music when Rose and Lucien go to the garden is so abrupt. 
The moment outside when Gerald give Rose the good news of the film right for traveling jones does not land strong enough to understand and the truly appreciate the rug getting pulled from under her. 
1:05:31 “For the last time im not your fucking Sammy” should be what we come in on from the scene in the garden. 
How was Delia dying to meet her but not know that Rose was an actress.
Couple of steps fwd and then back again feeling?
1:26:00:00 this whole unwinding is too long. 
Why does Sammy have the same color aura as Helen? They’re both dead? Empty?
How does Barbara not immediately see Helen.

     **4th or 5th Cut Mar 4 and notes from Mar 5, 2023**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     The scene with Helen needs to be even tighter. Sammy’s entrance could benefit from coming in a whole second later at least. 
When we see Helen break the door knob it seems a bit off for some reason. Would consider coming to that shot right at where the handle comes loose and she is left holding but build up to the moment with only the sound of someone trying to open a door over and over that would add even more tension to that build up with the “disconnected number” sounds.

     **3rd Cut Feb 17 2023**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     1:49:21
Some things are simply not understood:
	Mentions of the play and their past are very hard to understand
	Lois’ character is incomplete and does not land. All set up.
	Nepal is also all set up and no payoff
	Spirit Photos are not understandable.
