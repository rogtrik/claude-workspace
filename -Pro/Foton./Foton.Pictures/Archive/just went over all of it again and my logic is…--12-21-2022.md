# just went over all of it again and my logic is….

If they agree to remove Mexico… how much money does that leave us with and is it enough to get this thing made or will we need to cash flow that uncovered portion of the costs. Assuming that they honor the original full fee and everything else stays put. 

If they don’t remove Mexico and they don’t pay until we get Mexico which we know as a fact is a matter of months and we will not restart production until that point 

Melissa keeps insisting that all we need is a nudge from someone to remove the greenlight and that there is some logic to exploring the option of cashflowing ourselves which inherently removes a lot of components but generally we would still need to comply with all the Disney requirements.

Can’t get the idea out of my head of rocking the boat the least possible and proceeding with the deal as they want us to sign it… Agreeing with all their supervision and approval but still assuming the risk of cashflowing which would be a lot easier with a signed contract.

That would let us get the cash to start everything up again, have a chance of actually making our delivery deadline while also solidifying the project which I think should help move things on the Televisa side.
————————
I have cleared an additional 200K that can be used towards production funding. This should allow us to bring Gaby and Ale back on as well as look into the possibility of continuing the archival and post production processes. We need to run the numbers, but this should buy us enough time to make it to the end of February.
Additionally, we have a direct contact with Pierluigi Gazzolo, President and Chief Transformation Officer of TelevisaUnivision.
Mario is speaking with Armando today at 2pm in hopes of getting clarity and pushing progress.
I still believe that the change on behalf of Disney is not in good faith, and is not in line with what their position has been, since we began bankrolling this production on their behalf, since the second quarter of this year. 
We think that in order to engage most effectively with Televisa Univision in order to close the steel we will need to know what if any is, Disney is openness to exploring licensing, a later window of the series to Televisa. This will require that we speak with Jihan, or whoever has the authority to inform us of this leeway in order to continue the conversations with Televisa.
