After acquiring *[The Little Hours](http://deadline.com/tag/the-little-hours/)* at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, [Gunpowder & Sky](http://deadline.com/tag/gunpowder-sky/) is set to release the quirky comedy about nuns gone wild in theaters on June 30. Written and directed by Jeff Baena, *The Little Hours* follows three nuns, Alessandra ([Alison Brie](http://deadline.com/tag/alison-brie/)), Fernanda ([Aubrey Plaza](http://deadline.com/tag/aubrey-plaza/)), and Ginevra (Kate Micucci), who lead simple lives in their convent. Their world is disrupted when a young servant ([Dave Franco](http://deadline.com/tag/dave-franco/)) fleeing from his master takes refuge at their dysfunctional convent in medieval Tuscany. John C. Reilly, Molly Shannon, Fred Armisen, Jemima Kirke, Nick Offerman and Adam Pally, among others co-star.
