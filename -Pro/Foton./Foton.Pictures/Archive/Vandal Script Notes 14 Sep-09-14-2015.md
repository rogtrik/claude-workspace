Page 3. 
First Daks description is better.

Page 7
first dialogue. 
I don’t know man. Im tired of bombin the same walls (a beat) and the same women (beat) It’s like I’m in a

      loop.

Page 8
Face portraits redundant. 

Page 9
Artist does not say Damage…. Say “oh shit! mah brotha! how you been?” and they hug it out. 

When artist says getting paint to paint he is already turning around. Shorter interaction. And also a cleaner segue into Nicks next line to silk. If not it is too abrupt. 

Page 10
Nick Dialogue
Well now that you have maybe you’ll start seeing me up around the city. 

Page 13
not lithe. better description.

Page 14
mouthing fucking

after the he has the same effect on women we see a more vulnerable almost comedic role in this family dynamic as he looks at each of them waiting for a laugh.

Page 17
Sizmik does say that she writes silk. 

Page 18
Nicks line is too rough if he is smart and really macking it which he is. He would not say it like cause you wont fuck…. Its normal for icy to lash out when he cant get something he wants. Like a baby. 

Page 19
I’m not one of your dumb ass rich bitches… Yeah, I’ve heard all about you…. and you know what? I dont have any more time for you. nd  need to get back to work. This conversation is over. 

Hey* and if you ever dis me or my people again, I will fuck you up. 

Page 21 
Orly me estaba* diciendo que los IOK casi the parten el culo anoche. 

Que te digo yo… eso tipos son todos artistas… son de mentira. 

Page 22
Michael dialogue.
Tu te acuerdas del plan de la dispensary?/plan legal que te conté? Things are looking more realistic…

Rey Dialogue
(impressed and convinced) Y por que no comenzaste por ahí?

Page 24…
Instead of Yes sir I do… Its more like “that’s right….”

Detective speak needs to be checked for legitness.

Cut to black after their reaction of the death.

Page 26
His mind is not in the eighties his mind is in the real reason why graffiti was born and the reason why it will always be. 

Page 28…
I feel that we need to close with something tender and emotional before we leave the backyard scene. And it will give better temporal closure to the scene before we cut to the next one. 

Page 29
Exactamundo.

Page 30 
I would add a comedic tone to the whole scene with the suit… like they are completely aware of how ridiculous it is. 

Page 38
Pelaez last dialogue
Stop with that bullshit son. You think I don’t know what’s up? It’s my job to know what’s up.

Page 39
Pelaes first dialogie. 
Condolences to your crew for Pharo. He was one of the greats. Not that many like him are left. I remember him back when we were in Beach High together… how time flies.

PAGE 42 
I like the concept of the one trick pony… Would add it to dialogue.

Page 45
Sizmik laughs and Chino cracks him mid laugh. Slomo shit.

Page 46
Last Nick dialogue.
Delete if you know what I mean. 

Page 46-47
Jacob Dialoue

Still not clear on how a leader can be excommunicated in the case of sizmik… hes probably second tier at least… or miami is second tier to the ioks and the national ioks decide to take him out as a surrender offering to mgk to end the war..

Page 47
Jacob last dialogue
more context on the Nick Cruz and not Damage

Page 49
Miguel David says Greetings??? wtf?

Page 50
Delete Silk saying thanks. 

Page 51
Fucken haunted eyes

Page 62 
Last line still cheesy.

Around page 72 at the end of Michaels schpiel… it depends on perspective and explains...
add a moment in which Michael explains how he thinks that

why do you think Pharo did what he did? From his perspective he felt that he was done… that he had peaked years ago and that he had nowhere to go from there. You on the other hand are full of potential. 

Page 74 what happened with the hot sauce.

Page 75 
jumped right over Nick arriving and seeing her hurt… why?

Page 77 what a scene.

Page 81
This shit got insane expensive.

Page 82 The double death in the film is reallt feeling heavy at this point.

Page 83
Why is the graff red?

Fucking haunted eyes!

Page 84 
Post impressionistic?

Dont like the ghost scene.

Page 89
Your sprays?

Page 93
Sophies Choice?

Did not like the previous cnn thing and this one either…. I understand that somehow the cops are the bad guys in this world but we cannot go overboard with it.
