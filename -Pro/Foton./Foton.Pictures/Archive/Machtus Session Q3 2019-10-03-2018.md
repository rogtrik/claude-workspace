Overwhelmed with workload? Something going on at home?
I am really trying to make this work with you but I cannot risk any aspect of this opportunity and you are critical to it.
I want to help you get your goal we discussed last year of being able to focus on Emergent through in the meantime running our Business Development area.
Would like to make you CBO but there are things that I need to achieve and we need to talk these through to be on the same page:
Cash flow impact normalized for 12 months which also helps fix Economic disparity in FP.
Fundraising efforts on high gear again.
Really revive Emergent with the 50k donation.
We need to go back to the 2018 levels. Bonuses will be discretionary unlike before. 
If all goes to plan we can grow things again mid next year.
Chief Business officer. New area. Expectations

Based on where we are not only in FP but overall how do you see yourself growing with the organization?
Maintain CEO title with an evolving function. No longer leading the structure but more part of it w regards to FP. You will continue handling point on communications but much more in step with me and the rest of the team. 
The right hand needs to come into play in a way that I am not always the bad guy that drags us back to what our strategy should be. Hurting ourselves, the project and allies in the process.
Emergent has its moment of truth this year and I believe it to be a good idea to accept the inevitability of that transition and plot it out to be finished within the next 12 months at the most. 
Corporate communication and best practices are of utmost importance and you are the one who sets that example. 
The posture towards the market and the industry has changed. We are no longer an investment entity. We are a production company and as such should start to behave more revenue focused. 
Pitching of Foton and every project was completely sub par and you kept interrupting the direction I was trying to take the conversation in order to tell anecdotes.

Vision for yourself.
Vision for FP
Vision for Emergent
————————
Foton Supercharged
Evidence to date has shown our capacity in content development and curation, creative talent and process management, extremely detailed and consistent business acumen, fiduciary responsibility towards investors and ability to move within the market that has demonstrated appeal on behalf of creative and financial partners in generating trust and the desire to continuing to work with us. This takes me to the conclusion of needing to supercharge the S curve. 
Funding sources to Capitalize FP to the scale in which we envision operating. If we want to transcend this indie realm we will have to position ourselves accordingly. Our strategies and actions need to be supported by its business plan.
Partner or not reality. It is simply not true. Now... where does this stem from?
————————
New Structure proposal and true clarity.
CEO Meaning and expectations. 
	Figurehead
	You are not one. You are one with the entire organization.
	I, Me, Emerson becomes We, Us and Foton Pictures at all times. You are the leader and the organization at the same time. You speak on behalf of the company and although you will always be a producer you cannot fully shut down what you represent. You as is Foton are completely above the bullshit that we have encountered and effectively dealt with for all this time. 
Officers Expectations and growth.

Short/Mid $$$ Expectations
Long $$$ Expectations

Current setup / 10% Var Net of FP yearly operation.
This can be maintained and later evolved into actual stock. This would require a buy-in or a more formal stock option format to be defined.
