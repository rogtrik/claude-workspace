How come the tie breaker came into the language so late in the process?
What possible routes do you envision for the sale of the film in which not having this tie breaker would have been an issue for you?
This is completely out of the norm even for our passive plays so this becomes a serious leap of faith in our part and a potential bad situation with investors. 
That said we believe in what you guys are doing, love the project and really want to see this relationship grow.
