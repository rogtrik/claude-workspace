The locations are amazing... huge in scope and generic enough for it to be universal.
The witty dialogue with commentary is ahead of its time. 
The music is amazing... recognized so many of the songs from my childhood and a had never watched the movie in its entirety... I think.
The timing is very much of the time... hilarious how they even kept the fadeouts on the tracks. 
The fortune cookie vibe from the scarecrow scraps is essential. 

How specifically about PR do you want to make this.... or more like jumping off point and grounding for a universal message?

El Oz’ Isla Bonita is PR? Is there a message of añoramiento for our birth nation? Migrant specific or the oppressed?

The acting performances outside of the actual music perfomrances are very limited. Do you intend to keep it this way?

How based on the musical/movie do you want to make it?
