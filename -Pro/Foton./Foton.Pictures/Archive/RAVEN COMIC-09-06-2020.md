Things we like

Andrew:

Origin is 5 years before CB story. 

Minority Report and I Robot as references of the world.... combined with world of The Children of Men. Extreme class differences coexisting in the same timeline.  

Motivation for the govt testing. Living forever, it is a vain purpose, not for the betterment of humanity, it is only for a few. Like a weapon. 

Use current events and our capability to project forward.

Homeless population growing heavily. Climate Change, Race wars.  

XMen but feels more real... or should feel more real.
What are the situations that have caused the world to be like it is in Chris Black’s America. 

Young Characters / Rites of passage intertwined with this hero journey like Spideman

The antagonistic forces were 2 dimensional. 

Need more motivation beyond being rid of his powers. 

The reluctant hero aspect was too long. 

We have this origin... should be a girl... she discovers these powers 

Has to develop her skill... risk to herself and others

Finds a mentor... practice and develops and founds this movement. 

Once Chris Black shows up in the timeline she is the leader and has more to it. 

Then Chris Black’s story is more about choosing between these clear paths. 


Gov is testing on homeless people. If they die, they can cover their tracks. 

Carlos:
Diversity
Brown superhero
Race as a theme
Use drug testing as reason for universal income from the other idea I had.
