# 35k es el fee de FP de Too The Stars dado por Bending Light. So if…


 <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     35k es el fee de FP de Too The Stars dado por Bending Light. So if we say 50k is MFN then as a bottom line as producers we can say that FP defers exactly that much taking only 15k up front justifying our argument.
Feewise it puts our total at 50k upfront with 35k deferred. Not bad. 
Now on the Backend… we have already ceded on the bond, deferred most of our fee and we have to give up on this too? Entonces hit them with half, quarter or even 8th of MFN with other producers depending on where they are. Ahí no es problema real para las negociaciones porque mientras any of them dial back everyone does. But we get/give a little piece for putting our name on it. Although a small piece but you own it. 
When you say that BL owns it does not mean FP sees the cheddar beyond the fees. 
Mentalidad catalogo. 
BL is just a step to financing directly as FP in tandem with other sources. When you have skin in the game the conversation changes. And this is what gets us there. The chances of buying out partners is much simpler than later acquisitions. We are essentially pre selecting with out creative criteria and kind of tagging and releasing… Inception?
