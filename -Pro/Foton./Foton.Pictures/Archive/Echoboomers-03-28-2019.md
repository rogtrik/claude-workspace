     The current cut seems like a cut-down version of the Oldest cut from 10/02/19.  

Very few examples of material left unused but hard to see using premiere.

     The beats are not even getting a chance to land.
02:00:07:00 - They just fucked up to the point at which now they are messing with Mel and his people. They lost the guy with the addresses but lets cut into an amazing montage completely erasing any tension necessary to carry the Mel side of the story forward.


02:00:08:09 - Is this the same lady that interviewed Lance?

     **Writer Director**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Seth Savoy is green. Will look for more work but the Ballet peace is not great.

     **Producers**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Jeff Waxman has extensive and high level credits but very few as line producer. Is it normal that he functioned as a line producer but got a better credit?
Byron Wentzel has very cool and varied experience. More diligence.
Mike D Ware looks green. More diligence.
Line Producer / Carrie Holt Delama
DP / Andrew Wehde

     **Casting Director**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Allison Estrin and Henry Russell Bergstein. Hell of a track record. Maybe the secret sauce of this package.

James Langer as the most critical piece of this film. Follow up on his other project The Happening about Climate Change.

     **Script**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     We need to go through the emotional journey that Lance is going through. Likability on the gang and the characters should be tweaked slightly and be given more depth. We need to really feel the excitement and how at home Lance feels with them for the third act to truly have its complete effect. 
Ending feels abrupt.

     *Were there other versions.*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      
Reminiscent of Seven Pounds when although the twist might have been worth it the character was simply not likable. 
Feels like the 10% sticking it to the 1%. All white kids and only one woman.
Characters feel plastic. 
Interaction between Jack and Lance not realistic. Their arguments provide no depth. 
I have not connected with any of them? Just because they can’t get a job easily? Whiny babies.
The numbered rules could be played up and given a rightful place within the story structure. At times they provide it at times they sound like Wolf of Wall Street type statements like “never take no for an answer”
The movement needs to be reinforced. I believed the team in Mr Robot and in Baby Driver but not these guys. 
Their sloppiness coinciding with their well oiled machine moments provide inconsistency as well.

     **Lessons**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Lesson 1 / You gotta have that fuck you attitude.
Lesson 2 / When the system’s corrupt - why play by the rules?
Lesson 3 / Never take no for an answer.
Lesson 4 / Experiences are better than bank statements.
Lesson 5 / Fuck that. They weren’t lessons anymore, they were rules. 
Rule 5 / I they won’t let us dream, we won’t them sleep.
Rule 6 / Some of the most toxic people come disguised as friends.
Rule 7 / The best things in life are expensive, remember that.
Rule 8 / Sometime’s its better not to know the whole story.
Rule 9 / We all have a little evil in us, the trick is to find out how much. Betrayal never comes from your enemies.
Rule 10 / All the rules are bullshit.
