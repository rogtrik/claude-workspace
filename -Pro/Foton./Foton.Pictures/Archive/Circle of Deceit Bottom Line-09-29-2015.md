     Circle of Deceit Bottom Line

Two escrow accounts. 

1,000,000 against Domestic or equivalent Equity stake if actors come in. 

What would be the new cash flow needs?


What happens with Valda’s originally invested 200k? If she will recoup they must be in the budget. 260k already out to director/writer.

Unrecoupment scenario. In the case that Foton proceeds with just domestic rights but does not recoup from domestic then we would enter International to recoup from there. This should be the same case for Valda as the other equity partner in the film in that if she does not recoup from international she can finish recouping from Domestic.

     1. the budget is the budget we sent you. approx 4.27
2. its an all NYC shoot so total eligibility for tax credit. our lawyer steven beer will be handling. this is a no brainer. you dont apply before you're financed.
3.completion bond./  since we're not debt financing we don't need one. waste of money. there is 100k in contigency. you can add another 100k if you want to.  its only a ten day shoot so why was 85,000 on bond fee and need to have a 350k contigency. our production insurance covers most problems.
4.  there are no back end deals or deferments 
5. you approve all aspects of sales and who sells the film.  the US projections are based on previous Toback films.
6. the 60k was an advance to toback, paid on first day of principal photog.
7. the equity of 500k not negotiated. deal w. steven beer for valda witt
8. there are no official previous producer attachments or liens, speak to steven beer again
9. the talent is attached. obviously the film wont be cashflowed if there's a dropout and we would recast and delay.
