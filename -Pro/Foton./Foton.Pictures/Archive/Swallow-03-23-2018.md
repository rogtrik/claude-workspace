We are not interested if MarVista is still on the table. If they are no longer in the picture then...
Under the condition that everything stays exactly as is in your email with regards to the other equity and if Pulse is confirmed with terms agreeable to all we would propose the following:
Increase our position to 350k
If emergency loan wants to convert to pure equity we would be at 650k
If not then we would propose to use our increase to replace the 100k loan leaving us at 550k of pure equity.
We would need for John and David to be contracted and funded before moving forward with our funding. 
We would keep all our other terms as they are with regards to credits et al
This would leave the need from pulse at 400k or 500k depending on the scenario.
If/when Pulse is fully contracted and committed into the project, with all terms agreeable to current parties we would be capable and willing to bridge Pulse and only Pulse. This would require direct communication and negotiation with Pulse.
