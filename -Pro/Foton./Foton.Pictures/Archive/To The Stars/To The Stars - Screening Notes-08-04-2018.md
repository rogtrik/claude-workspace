2:49 Once Iris is clearly heading back towards the barn you could cut sooner to that beautiful dolly along her walk. Easy 3 seconds. 
3:04 To a lesser amount there is like a second on the dolly shot that once the Barn is completely in frame you could cut out a tad sooner. 
3:28 Iris’ reaction when caught peeping could get to her walking away even sooner instead of seeing the walk start so slowly in the CU… it should come off as more nervous/embarassed and will also make more sense with how far she has walked by the time Jeff sees her. 
3:49 You could cut out of the wide as soon as the little whirlwind passes her. Like a second or less sooner than where it cuts now. Think it would almost justify the glasses readjustment.
4:37 Do you have any shots of Hal to intercut with the shot of Iris when he says “then she’ll be waiting a long time then” for example?… Really enjoyed disliking that character when I went through the footage. Don’t know if you are taking advantage of the wide shot at that particular moment to piece together some dialogue or performance pieces from different takes but I feel it would be more effective earlier on when he is creeping up on her and the car sketchily riding alongside… as the scene escalates would maybe prefer the close up of Iris that you have but would add some more shots or even additional insults from Hal to add to the tension that is building up until the point that the books get knocked down. 
4:53 The Batman Maggie effect I mentioned at the first screening has worn off over viewings. Maybe with audio it could tipped off and less sudden. Now having seen it a few times what sticks out to me is the fact that there is this neat pile of rocks ready to fire… maybe start higher up on that shot?
5:39 I remember seeing a shot of Hal having a much closer call getting hit by the rock. I think it was the last take 5S_3. Also his face of fear caused by Maggie when he sees the rock coming was pretty good on the last take you have in the footage and if possible would maybe consider adding a couple of frames before the rock hits to see that fear. Also after the close call that he peeks back out at Maggie actually afraid now is very satisfying. You could go, near miss, maggie, peek back out, jumping onto the truck.
5:44 Shot 5Q_2 has a cool “Ill get you bitch!” you could use before going back to Maggie.
6:31 After “Welcome to Oklahoma” you could cut out earlier from the wide to the school. Once you have her clearly walking towards the car.  2 easy seconds.
6:35 Would catch this first establishing shot later. Once the student comes into frame from the left. And would cut out sooner. Just about a second.
6:49 I would cut out from the second establishing a bit sooner as well. Almost 5 seconds. Right when the girls are lined up between the two cars. 
7:15 I really like this hallway shot. Would try to keep as much as possible. Would maybe cue the music a bit sooner right at the moment the hallway is empty maybe taking 1 second less to get to the bathroom. 
8:04 I would cut into this classroom dolly shot later. Right when the student finishes crossing across the camera. Cutting a bit of the beginning and starting with “come on up sweetie”
9:03 Would go from “…Bunsen Burner” to the assignments skipping the school being liable line. 
9:35 would start this shot with “so what’d he do” cutting a bit from the beginning starting just when Iris is getting close to the microscope. Around 3 seconds in.
9:59 Clarissa  asks “Why are you laughing…. Nothing” could be tighter. Would have the “nothing” almost stepping on the question giving a more nervous reaction feel and appreciating her pause right after even more. 
12:31 Would skip the first “on the hood” shot.
13:03 Would take a second off each of these establishing shots. 
13:05 This dissolve into the pan is beautiful!
13:24 Would cut into this shot as soon as the foot comes down. Taking a second or two off the beginning. 
15:27 When Len is staring and Barbara reacts to it I would cut back to Len again still staring just for a bit before going to Edith for her reaction.
15:45 I would eliminate Malin’s walk and start with her putting the food down on the table to accentuate the cut.
16:43 I would cut into this shot later… starting just a second before the focus to Maggie. 
16:54 Would cut to black on “…love others around us” and keep the prayer over the black. 
17:03 Would cut from black to this sooner eliminating the silence with the music from the TV almost interrupting the prayer at “…we do not deserve them”.
19:01 I would cut to the next shot around here once Iris already has her sweater. 
19:13 Would cut the first 5-6 seconds of this shot.
19:43 Do you have the let me disappear part of the dialogue for this part on any take? Felt like it needed to be set up more clearly for the “let her disappear! let her disappear!” to work best at the end of the film.
19:51 Would shorten the beginning of this shot to get to her getting startled a bit sooner. 
22:21 “Your no better… It’s disgusting” line is very hard to understand. Generally the performance from Iris is very good at transmitting her personality, mousy nature and almost mumbly way of talking but felt her volume was consistently low throughout the filme and would recommend raising her volume to not lose out on understanding some of the deep like the plains of Oklahoma things she does say. 
25:57 Would cut away from this shot as soon as Maggie shuts the door. 
26:26 Would hold on the wide shot for the standoff and then cut to the next shot once Maggie is about to open the car door cutting her walk over entirely. 
29:47 Beautiful doorway shot but would trim 2-3 seconds from the beginning.
30:15 Would cut into this shot here. Cutting like 6 seconds from the beginning. Starting with Jeff looking down.
31:51 I would stay with her close up, extending it covering all the same action if it exists and replacing the next wide and dissolve from her looking back at the house to Maggie under the covers.
32:12 I don’t know if the solution is isolated to this scene but it is the best example of a greater feeling of pity instead of anger towards Francie. It’s kind of like poor her at times and although I love the ambiguity you have added to how she can be perceived it could be better served with letting her play the villain a bit more. It should be more effective for the arc that Iris has in how she looks at her Mom and accepting her at the end of the movie. 
36:42 Would cut the beginning of this shot. Coming in right when Maggie has already started to walk over to Iris.
49:09 The reveal of the bruise is more evident in color. Actually didn’t even catch it the first time around in b&w. Do you have a way of accentuating it with the grade or another take?
50:07 No tighter shots of this? Especially when she takes off the glasses and steadies herself. 
1:10:20 Would cut out when she asks if she can put the box on the counter. 
1:33:03 The men are not shitty enough and weirdly quiet. I love the fact that the fear can be felt on both sides but would you consider adding audio of the men insulting her and maybe grunts and other angry and disgruntled noises? Maybe even nervously spouting the odd insult under their breath. Seeing them as the example followed by the kids that harass Iris they seem a bit tame with their words.
1:34:22 I would start to fade to black a bit sooner. 
1:35:23 This needs music or something to make it more climactic. What is actually there given how apologetic she is and then leaves would benefit from it.
