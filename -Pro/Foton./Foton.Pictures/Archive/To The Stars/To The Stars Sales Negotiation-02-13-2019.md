Any number that is below what we believe to be the true minimum market value of the product cannot come from us. If not then we pass. 
This is an american story, shot in oklahoma and was in comptetition for the grand jury prize at what is arguably the most prestigious american film festival. 
This film was supposed to be stronger in US than anywhere else and we are looking at an MG that is on par with our 400k Slamdance that was sold by Submarine. Makes no sense. 
SG always lowballs.
