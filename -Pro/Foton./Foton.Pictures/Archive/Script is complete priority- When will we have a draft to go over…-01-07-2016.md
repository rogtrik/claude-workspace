Script is complete priority. When will we have a draft to go over based on December 21 meeting.

Budget / Line Producer is our second priority. 

We need to know how much this script will cost to produce.

We need to be very conscious of the fact the we are making an indie festival film and the originally flexible budget should have a hard cap at 1.5 or even less. 

Another thing to take into account is that with the expenditures at this point we will be closer to 200k for Development Costs. We really need to be careful with this as this already leaves us with just 1.3 for the movie itself.
