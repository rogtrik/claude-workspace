Vandal Film Outline Notes



I think we still need to connect with Nick even more… there is an almost instinctual need in all of us to leave our mark and if there is one ideal way to represent that visually is graffiti… so if we see small sparks of this intention and this feeling that grows and evolves normally throughout a man’s life we will not only see more depth and evolution but also be able to connect and relate with Nick in a very viscerally basic human level. 

The cop storyline will be better served with at least one more narrative touchpoint within the script.
