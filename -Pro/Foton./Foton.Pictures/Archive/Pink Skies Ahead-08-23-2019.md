     **8/16/19 Notes for 9/12/19 Cut**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     3:23 Do we by any chance have other shots of the action of writing in the notebook? Maybe some up close? 
Really love how the VO has evolved through the cuts.
08:00 Would you consider using some other establishing or passage of time in between the previous scene and the baby picture?
14:43-44 This cut seems to double on the action of Ben turning to Winona when she is writing her number on a napkin. 
The walk out with Robert from the house to the car is fucking beautiful. Everything about it is just perfect.
Henry Winkler is AMAZING. All the performances feel tighter. 
Have really enjoyed the progress in the cut. 
Cards at the end are great.

     **8/23/19 Notes for 8/19/19 Cut**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size: 15.0;text-align: left;">
     **General Notes**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     The utilization of wide and tighter shots in the scenes could be cut better at service of the intensity of a scene or to capture performances more clearly. In general tighter shots will improve the feel of the film and the added cuts will add pace without losing story. As an example the scene of the last job interview at the book store is perfect and this regard and the comment would not apply. 
Do we have more of Addie and Matthew? They are really great on screen and provide a good balance of how we see Winona. Would be great to see them MUCH throughout in the movie.
Journal entry V.O. idea from Monday seems like a very organic device given the characterer and can help to enhance the narrative and pacing. We’d suggest some appearances here and there of the V.O.
More 90’s references! Right now the only one is the Ross from Friends mention and obviously SOME of the songs although some are even from the 80’s that are great but could throw off the intention of the music as context for time. A tidbit of sociopolitical? Maybe Robert is watching news instead of the movie? Or other element? It could also be mentioned within the V.O. In the script this felt like it provided context for Winona’s disaffection with life understood within how capitalistic and competitive the 90’s were.
Could we show the ear ringing more in the first act as well? Maybe like setting it up almost mysteriously to some degree? Otherwise, we’re going to be thinking too much about what was the one thing that triggered the panics during the second act. Is there a single moment that serves as that initial trigger? Maybe the ringing is already there around the car crash or when she’s following her dad? Or when she hears her parents are moving? If done very subtly most won’t even notice it that early on until a second viewing. Ringing needs to be chosen wisely as to not be confused with foreshadowing of mystery or horror. 
Overall, the first act is the main lag the movie has. We should cut down on lingering moments, less establishing shots up here and maybe move them to later in the movie. 
We should try to introduce the character dynamics quicker. 
The 3rd act is great!

     **Technical Notes**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Overall, we need to really focus on the sound design. The movie has many moments (even the starting scene at the driving test) that feel very quiet.

     **Time Code Notes**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     01:01:20:16 This walk can be tightened and the jump cuts within the same shots could stay as part of the visual language of the whole scene and go in crescendo throughout the sequence in Winona’s room and all her stoned activities culminating on the shot of her smoking. Currently these cuts happen only outside of the house and in her room, if it instead is throughout the entire song it will flow better.
1:02:48 - Starting here, should we maybe cut some of the montage. The scenes look great, but there’s almost 45 seconds before the V.O. kicks in that could maybe be trimmed a bit.
01:02:51:08 In Winona’s room we could benefit from more situations of her doing things if they exist. Also in combination with the previous note, some quicker intercutting between the different activities could provide an opportunity for more comedic timing and feeling of a faster pace without losing runtime. 
1:02:55:03 - This opening montage after the credits tends to drag out a little. Editing this montage tighter and shorter. Same images that are being used work great, it more about shaving off a couple frames within those images and finding different cut points. 
01:05:33:17 We could have the “Good News” part of Winona’s line from the next scene be heard over the last frames of her Mom’s disappointed look contrasting the perspectives even further. 
01:05:43:14 Is there a tighter shot of just Steph that could be intercut with Winona’s opening line? That way we don’t reveal the location yet and use the action of Steph jumping the counter to cut to the wide?
01:05:53:02 The cut from wide to medium here seems a bit abrupt as Steph’s head is not facing the same way. Could it be improved?
01:06:13:20 Is it possible to not cut out to the wide here and stay at the CU and use the “Ok Recap” line to cut back to the wide instead?
01:06:18:10 - Right as Stephanie says recap, do we have a take when its an MCU or her coverage of that scene. Cutting to her when she does the final recap, then cutting back to the two shot right before she fake blows her brains out,  I think makes that action land a little bit stronger, and make Wynona’s joke afterward funnier. 
1:06:35 - Not sure we need the sprinklers. Maybe only the car POV prior to Winona and Dad.
01:06:45:17 All these establishing shots take out the funny timing of going from Winona’s line of “you are being a bit dramatic but ok” from the previous scene cut directly to Winona wearing the hat. Instead the establishing shots can be spread out throughout the scene to accentuate the uncomfortable silences. 
1:07:09 - This is some of the toughest driving moments to buy with Winona. The curve by 1:07:12 starts looking fake after rewatching, and also, I noticed that her eyes veer off for long periods of time here anywhere but in the road. Could we cut some of this to Robert more often?
01:07:54:03 The armpit pain is hard to notice here beyond her wincing and we can’t really see what if bother her. Is there a way to play it up more with the existing material?
01:08:01:10 The transition from Winona taking her dad to work to her walking in suburbia to Addy’s seemed fine in the script but in the film it feels a bit disconnected or as if there is something missing in between. Is there anything that can be used for this? Other establishing? Dropping off dad at the office? Seeing the establishing change from office to suburbia so there is a change of location or feeling of passage of time?
1:08:35 - Were Addie and Matthew not supposed to be chatting or almost quarreling with each other AND Winona? Is Matthew cooking? Can’t tell what he’s exactly doing there.
01:10:24:02 Establishing of the clinic, doc’s office would be great. 
01:10:30:06- Do we have insert shots of the babies? Like start with insert shot of a couple of the white babies before Wynona says her line that cut out to the shot with all the babies? 
1:12:00 - Henry Winkler is AMAZING throughout.
01:12:51:04 Winona’s reaction here seems strange is there another take? Same applies to the last line of the scene at 01:13:06:23
01:13:08:23 Establishing of the office building or area would also help to bring more LA to the film as well as keep the viewer better situated in the story. 
1:13:18 - I actually don’t buy the coffee overfill scene. Jess reacts too late to it almost. Different take or cut? The whole intro to the office here is not my favorite pace wise.
01:13:39:00 - In the short set-up of Winona in the office, is there another shot of at her desk “working”. The two shots of her walking into the office, and pouring coffee feel awkward.
01:13:47:08 Is Winona’s dad taking his anxiety meds right now? Very subtle ringing here?
01:14:23:00 Would it be worth establishing the 7eleven before the magazine cover shot? Believe it is an important location for the story and we come back to it? More LA also.
01:14:46:18 Steph stealing the things in the back intercut more with Winona talking to Kevin could make it seem like Win was distracting him on purpose as well as set up her surprise of the stolen goods later even more. 
1:14:55 - Could we linger just a tad longer at the beginning of this scene before the dialogue? It’s a cool transition.
1:16:20 - This is one scene where the needle drop doesn’t need to be The Smiths. Cheapen the song here.
01:18:42:01 Performance willing it would be great to have more of the 3 of them running away after they tag up the mattress.
01:20:38:22 Without losing any frames from Winonas reaction does a close up of her dad exist for the “we thought you had moved out line” to cut in with it? Are there any tighter shots of the parents that can be used for this scene? Would benefit the feeling of Winona’s anxiety if we stay only in those tighter shots of each of them starting from a moment that makes sense to her stress level. Could also give a feeling of fragmentation between the parents off Winona’s resistance/reaction to the idea. A tighter shot of the mom reaching out at 01:19:51:21 would also be beneficial to play up how “overbearing” Winona feels her to be. 
1:21:00 - Her non understanding in the previous comment makes her reaction here with her dad almost excessive OR, it makes it look like she’s devastated because she DOES know she’s moving out.
01:21:06:00 This walk from the house to the car is fucking beautiful. Everything about it is just perfect.
01:21:20:05 The phone split screen is a great element in this film. Is there a way to have a last one at the end of the film? It feels like we would use it at least one more time as they mostly focused on the earlier part of the movie. Particularly at the end when we go back to optimism. Dare  I say it would it be worth writing such a moment to give the structure more symmetry?
01:22:00:18 Might verge on overuse of the resource but if a shot of what Winona is seeing happen in the office exists then maybe that half of the screen could cut to it before we see her reaction or maybe TRIPLE SPLIT SCREEN MADNESS…?
01:22:25:04 Musically could there be a kind of theme specific for Winona in detective mode? Currently there is something but it is used in other “unraveling” moments and not just for the detective stuff.
01:24:11:23 Is this ADR? Could we stay with the 2 shot seeing their face for these lines and just use this for the touch on the shoulder?
1:24:20 to 1:24:35 - Winona has many facial different facial reactions in this small scene that looked weird to me upon reviewing. Is it because she’s wired with sugar? Could that justify it? Otherwise, I’d look for more uniform reactions here.
01:24:22:19 Is there a tighter shot that can be used to insert in the middle of this cut? It seems abrupt a la 30 degrees.
01:24:34:04 Could we see the action of Pamela putting on her glasses?
01:25:00:00- When the boy asks her out for the date, the line “ I know it’s last minute and you probably can’t go” then he asks her for a nice dinner. He never clarifies the dinner is for tonight. Maybe if he adds tonight in the end of that sentence, it ties in the last minute line before that, and establishes when they are having dinner, it’s that very evening. 
01:28:40:22 This cut could be tightened catching Ben’s gesture towards the waiter more seamlessly. It repeats currently. Hard to catch the exact frame with Vimeo though.
1:29:10 - Pacing comment, I would cut  here before we stay with them savoring their drinks or maybe prelap the next scene’s song. Specially since the next scene is at the store talking about Ben.
01:33:17:15 Does Winona flip the book again to show the cover while we are already on the establishing shot? Could we stay on it to make sure it reads? Is there an intention for this establishing in showing a difference to where Ben lives? If so it is not as appreciated without other establishing in previous locations that contrast with this more clearly for those that do not know LA.
01:34:44:10 Are there tighter shots of this scene to intercut with?
1:35:11 - Love this scene but we need more of a record scratch feel to what happens to Winona here. Do we have closeups of Winona when Ben corrects her? Or reactions of others? Bigger awkward pause after she says it? Maybe background music could be a bit louder here.
1:36:24 - Is it me or should Winona feel more than embarrassed here and it seems like there’s a little smile here on her part? Is there a take where she looks more humiliated by the whole thing?
01:36:27:18 Is there more coverage of this scene to intercut with?
1:36:47 - This whole scene with mom on the yoga mat could be tighter. It’s a pace change after the cancer party and the store with Addie.
01:41:34:00 Seems strange to go back to this wide shot at this moment. Could we maybe start with this wide shot instead and once we go tighter maybe on the “have you made any recent changes in your life” staying there unless we want to accentuate any pauses and leaving the other wide shot only to close the scene? The moving dolly cut with the still shots are a bit jarring. 
1:41:34 - We need to cut to Mary J Blige WAY more.  She’s great in the movie! We’re focusing too much on Winona in this whole scene.
01:42:21:16 Why not see Dr Monroe deliver these lines? No need to remove any of the time we are on Winona as it will add to the pauses and let this scene breathe a bit more. More Mary!!
01:43:41:06 We should almost see no dollying-in in this scene until this exact moment. 
01:44:28:12  Would reserve this wide shot only for the close here but would cut to it a bit later after Dr Monroe says the she knew Winona would be a cryer. And maybe even staying on Winona crying a tad longer. 
01:46:28:15 The city street establishing with all the green in Winona’s background don’t seem to match. Looking at the bus stop maybe it’s the establishing shot that needs to change.
01:48:03:13 Would it be worth it to stay with Winona a bit longer here?
01:48:43:18 Would cut in to Winona’s tighter shot on the “what were they doing?” line. 
01:49:51:20 Could we see a bit more of Pamela’s reaction?
01:50:14:10- This is an interesting moment instead of reading that she got in, we can have a voiceover moment of her writing in her journal. 
1:51:02 - If we’re still looking for an alternative to The Cure here, maybe Modern English’s “I Melt With You” or Echo And The Bunnymen’s “Lips Like Sugar” could be more accessible?
01:51:35:00 The door slamming after she finds the boxes should be the cut point in the scene. The scene lasts for a couple of frames too long
01:53:51:17 Could the “winona!?” line be delivered in the wide shot and have Winona’s reaction take us to the tighter shots?
1:53:52 - More Mary J!
01:54:18:20 Maybe have the guy deliver “same” in the wide shot and “always the stairs” in the CU
01:54:20:00 Could the “oh god… Should I be?” line be covered in Winona’s CU?
01:54:20:00 The girl in this scene is fantastic! Mary J is barely covered in this scene. Can we add more coverage of her in this scene?
01:54:39:00 Would use this Wide shot way more than the other. Leaving the other one exclusively for open/close and for when they all raise their hands.
01:54:59:19 Could we us the “it was bonkers!” line to cut in from the Wide here?
1:55:54 - What’s that laughter at the end of the scene right after “diarrhea”?
01:56:00:23 This song already has the break later so as soon as we go to the line outside of the club it could be full blast on the cut instead of fading in as we have it.
1:57:32 - I’d be careful again here the Winona doesn’t go from mid “cum face” to serious one frame to the next. Felt like a small continuity issue?
01:58:11:14 Is there a tighter shot of Winona’s reaction here?
02:00:31:13 - This is a great way to have her do a voiceover over this montage about how great her life is at the moment. 
02:01:49:00 This walk could be shorter. Maybe reinsert the visual device of the jumpcuts from when we first see Winona walk to her house and implemente throughout this montage. 
2:03:10 - Depending on deal, a good alternative for the Pixies song could be Lemonheads “Shame About Ray”, Sugar’s “If I can’t Change Your Mind” or Cracker’s “Low”. 
2:04:30 - Do we have alternate POV here showing properly Winona is following her dad’s car? Maybe right before the crash? I think it could be funnier if we build this scene before the crash a little bit more. Do we have more material for this?
02:05:44:14 This wider shot could be shortened a bit.
02:07:41:00 We stay on this shot of Pamela leaving a bit too long.
02:08:42:02 This is the first time really hear the ringing. If the intention was to limit the ringing to the panic attack itself and not so much the anxiety maybe they could be variations of the ringing. 
02:21:34:09 Seems like an audio sync issue or something but when Winona asks “walk in closets?” it sounds a bit off with the image. 
02:26:44:12 We stay on this shot a bit too long. 
2:26:00 - Could it be that the panic attack sequence is a bit too long? I think it’s great how it’s shot and edited and scored, but at well over 3 minutes it might be a bit too much. It risks breaking part of the tone of the movie. Thoughts?
02:26:00:00 - I think the the current edit of the panic attack, which is beautifully shot, and great sound design, doesn’t in my opinion highlight the anxiety that Wynonna is really facing. Any thoughts about re-tooling this sequence to a little more chaotic state, have the audience be right there with Wynona, as opposed to watching her from the sidelines? 
02:27:03:19 This shot seems a bit unnecessary for how little it is used. Would remove or expand slightly.
02:27:39:05 The lens effect of her POV could bleed into the other clean shots to accentuate certain moments. 
02:29:48:23 Maybe the cuts can become a bit more frequent and frantic as the panic attack escalates. It also might go for a bit too long.
02:31:02:21 The off the action of Pamela moving over to the bed could be smoother. Also when we cut back from her line of “No I will not” the timing of hand position on Winona’s face is off.
02:31:22:20 Do we have a version of Robert taking this realization a bit harder? or we could stay on him for a couple more frames to accentuate. 
2:32:55 - If Robert’s known this woman for 30 years, wouldn’t it be that Pam would at least know her name and acknowledge who she is? Is there any material where this is mentioned? Does it matter?
2:33:08 - I don’t like the reaction Winona has to Pam saying “you do the same thing to me”. It’s almost like out of sync dramatically. Is there different coverage for this?
02:37:48:05 Would give a couple of frames for the reaction after the “all the best ones do” line.
02:38:10:04 I LOVE “Teardrop” but for those who know it from House or at least associate that song with it will be hard pressed to not connect dots of the theme of the movie, the fact that a medical mystery was just resolved and the fact that HOUSE was a series about solving medical mysteries.
2:38:10 - If we’re looking for alternatives to Massive Attack here a couple of options to try could be Mercury Rev’s “Holes”, The Church’s “Under The Milky Way”, Portishead’s “Sour Times” or “Glory Box”, etc. I’ll keep thinking of options here if needed.
