Que onda Meg and Brooke… Laurie’s roommate.
How do you envision the closing musical numbers at the end of each episode.
Love playing with aspect ratios
Planos secuencia no mames pero pila con el repeatability by other directors. Pilot directors need to have that in mind unless they intend to direct the entire series that they are setting the tone and style and although all attempts will be made to keep and achieve it the process will never be completely identical when others do it.
Where do we leave the ending of the second season?
Beyond the script of the pilot should we consider any adjustments to the deck? Can we expand what we have currently in parallel to the pilot script?

Whole chunks of the plot may be left out, because this is a twenty-seven-chapter book being squeezed into what is usually a movie of two to three hours.
/Mendoza Sisters/
Louisa May Alcott’s novel, Little Women, has maintained a connection with the female voice since it’s 1868 publication. Unlike previous works, Little Women celebrated the struggle of working women and the relationships that get them through. Little Women’s insight into the lives of working women has only developed more relevant over time. In this adaptation, the March sisters’ story has grown with the audience, while their personalities and ambitions remain stagnant. Through the current and relatable Mendoza sisters, viewers will fall in love with Alcott’s text on a deeper level. 
Little Women has been adapted as both a feature film and for television, but never before has the film been updated with a contemporary, modern take. This fresh take on Little Women will hold unto the novel’s original roots while captivating a new audience. In our adaptation, the Mendoza sisters live in Queens, New York. They reside with their Father while their military mother is stationed in the Middle East. 
We are introduced to this family in midst of crisis. Their house is in foreclosure and one of the sisters, Beth, will soon return from prison. We open with Jo, Megan, and Amy outside of their blue collar row house; the sisters moving their things and anxiously preparing for Beth’s arrival. How will she cope in the event of her mother’s absence, her childhood home in foreclosure, and assimilating into her everyday life again? Unfortunately, none of the sisters can seem to answer the question: Was Beth really a drug addict or simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time? 
The Mendoza sisters move into their Aunt Carol’s Lavish Manhattan apartment. Dropped off by her Parole officer, Beth joins her sisters on the Upper East Side. The reunion is awkward to say the least and certainly not the warm welcome she had hoped for. Along with Beth, each sister finds themselves in new, trying situations. 
Megan, the oldest Mendoza sister, feels responsible for the financial and emotional wellness of her family. To support them, she takes a nanny job for an extremely wealthy family on the Upper East Side. What seemed like a great idea, turns into a daily reminder of all the things she yearns for- material and immaterial. The second oldest, Jo, short for Josefina, has enough on her plate as is. She is interning at a big investment bank, trying to prove herself and support her unstable family. At the bank, she quickly experiences the truths of being an overlooked female in a male centric work environment. Lastly, Amy, the youngest sister, is an aspiring dancer. In her pursuits, she finds herself relying on her dubious ex-boyfriend. 
The updated setting and take on Alcott’s novel maintains the coming- of- age moments and family dynamics that make this story timeless. While these women struggle to find their place, they find comfort in each other.
