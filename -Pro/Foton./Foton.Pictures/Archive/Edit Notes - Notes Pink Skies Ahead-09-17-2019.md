The utilization of wide and tighter shots in the scenes could be cut better at service of the intensity of a scene or to capture performances more clearly. In general tighter shots will improve the feel of the film and the added cuts will add pace without losing story. As an example the scene of the last job interview at the book store is perfect and this regard and the comment would not apply. 
Do we have more of Addie and Matthew? They are really great on screen and provide a good balance of how we see Winona. Would be great to see them MUCH throughout in the movie.
Journal entry V.O. idea from Monday seems like a very organic device given the character and can help to enhance the narrative and pacing. We’d suggest some appearances here and there of the V.O.
More 90’s references! A tidbit of sociopolitical in the journal entries? Maybe Robert is watching news or any other 90s content instead of the movie? The “watching….. this” line is quite flexible. Or other element? It could also be mentioned within the V.O. In the script this felt like it provided context for Winona’s disaffection with life understood within how capitalistic and competitive the 90’s were.
