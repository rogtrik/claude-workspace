Entire stringout… if it does not exist… Rez stringout and ending stringout. 
terminaste de ver HATYM? Yo ando halfway y es prácticamente lo mismo… they have simply solidified the decisions they made by smoothing out cuts but beyond that there is clearly a very decided vision that has sunk in. Do not see the purpose of even doing more notes. Tomorrow is kind of a do or die moment. Or we give in which I think we should never do or we need to proceed in the most political and smooth manner towards the giving us 2 weeks from the moment we have access to all the material and have a plan which I am sure we can put together quickly… Intrigued to see if the editor is also being overly influenced like Richie and those few moments of good stuff that have since disappeared are more his? maybe he has his own ideas?
it is improved in certain aspects so I can see how SI would allegedly check out
like they complied… como que “ahi está la vaina”
the tv moments are brought even more randomly and weakly than before… and still has the worst parts
there are quite a few truly cheesy moments
the crotch grabbing and everything seems so much more out of place
even though it should have been taken out many cuts ago based on comments
Rez’s super dark reaction in the hospital is almost like he is possessed without all the weird talk before
why is Matthew surprised at the same sex scene Kearney had already emailed to him.

     Knowing fully well that it might seem like we are disagreeing with some notes or what might have been interpreted as the way to go from the test screening but we believe that this film needs to own up to what it is. Own the fucking “weird” and crazy that is in the story and in the mindfuck visual elements that we have. I feel that what I just watched is a combination of differing visions of where they want this film to go. 
In the current cut the “weird” stuff starts later and plays against the total experience. We should start from the beginning as we had it and reach that understanding with our audience that they are on board this kind of ride. 
With this in mind we would recommend going to the previous cut used for the test screening only if it indeed is a closer rendition to Eoin’s vision and work from that one. Starting with that but including the new things that were added into this most recent cut like the narration as well as rescuing a couple of sections that worked really well from even earlier cuts like what could be an improved version of Jen and Matthew’s summer montage. 
In short we should respect the story we set out to make embracing all its “weirdness” while giving ourselves the freedom to react and adapt based on what we actually have as material. Play with chronology? Is there a way to push back the Rez suicide so we avoid the double crescendo we have that creates a valley in between the second and third acts?
I agreed with removing some elements related to the “surreal” realm of the film like specifically the parents inside the TV or most of the moments we see that world through the TV instead of going fullscreen/into the minds of our characters. The TV is a great trigger but when sustained it is not a strong enough visual element. Now this does not mean that the “surreal” TV side of our story should be cut down as much as it is now. It is a necessary part of the experience of watching this film.

GENERAL
We should find a device/motif for all the alternate reality moments in the film. I mention several moments and potential solutions to it in the notes. 
If we are jumping in time as well as between realms I think we need ways to navigate this better as an audience. Don’t want to go the way of chyron’s but would definitely consider audio cues, transitions, extended blacks with audio like was introduced in the beginning of the film. Maybe consider relative time instead of absolute… one month later or since graduation as opposed to June, July or xxxx days since 9/11 instead of the year etc. Provide more context and help orient the passage of time a bit better. Entire months passing seemed off at times during this cut. 
During the first scene would you consider maybe cutting to Matthew from black on the line “I asked you if you were excited” for the first thing we see to bee the look on his face that merits “are you still with me?”  and that we see a couple of frames before the reaction to the line compared to where we are now. 
Would try to hold more on the shots facing Matthew on the walk over from the school… building up to this one in order to get more expressions and reactions to all the things going through his mind during the whole walk over… culminating when he looks down the middle of the street. 
I would go from the shot of Matthew walking down the street to the shot of Matthew throwing away his tie and THEN cutting to Kearney for the first time walking around the corner so we can appreciate his reaction and assume he knows Matthew before they talk.
Would give this shot from behind the three of them as they walk back towards the school at least one more second.
Do we have more establishing shots for all locations? Would love to be able situate myself more in the world you guys have captured. Feel the city more. The houses the kids live in, the neighborhoods they party at. Is it possible to get some of this or is there any?
Would give the moment of them flicking off the camera another second to let it have full impact.
After they flick off the camera you introduce the channel flipping transition as well as the security camera pov for the first time. With regards to the reasoning and logic behind the TV channel change and in general our parallel TV universe I feel there needs to be a more consistent logic or identification of when it comes in and out i.e. Motif. What actually triggers it is not clear… it happens when they are hungover, or drunk, or in America, or getting a tattoo, or feeling guilty? There should be an audio and-or visual cue/motif to take us there and when it happens there needs to be a puzzle for us to solve as an audience. Why and when do these happen and what am I seeing? Not pretending to answer any of these questions at all but nothing wrong with providing some lighthouses in there. 
Generally I feel both Kearney and Rez can be played up more. In this moment as they walk to the back entrance of the school for example I remember one more shot in which Kearney is more in the lead of this entire break-in situation. This is really a Kearney moment and if possible with the coverage acquired I would recommend he really own the moment, play up and foreshadow the kind of character he is, play up the crowbar moment moment a bit more please. This also becomes a more general comment regarding all key moments for Kearney and Rez in which they need to shine more brightly and really become the focus of attention in that moment. We need to feel the influence that I imagine Matthew is being affected by with these strong close friends.
That same audio and-or visual cue/motif could be present at this moment as well. When Matthew reacts to Rez jumping in on the destruction. I think I heard some effect applied to the dialogue in this cut and if that is the chosen path I would at least try to apply it more uniformly across these moments.
There is a shot of the final pull back from the stage at the end of the club scene in which the crowd moves into view in a much more coordinated manner making it less obvious that a camera is present. I would also hold that pull back one more second before cutting out of this scene.
This banter as they leave the club is great. Is there more of it that you would consider could be added back into the film? 
The first proper introduction of the parallel realm story device. Honestly would skip the parents being in the TV and would stick to the Leads and the TV Show characters being the only ones that carry over to that realm. If not maybe consider going full screen with the parents sooner.
In Kearney’s house above in his room we have the security camera angle again. Why is this here? How does this all connect with the TV realm? 
This audio right as Matthew is looking out into the ocean before the ball comes into frame is a great example of the audio and/or visual cue I was mentioning as well as a good moment for it. 
I would extend both the lead up to the crash and the aftermath almost bringing in the motif earlier so we don’t go so sudden from the happy drugs music to the crash almost feels like a PSA. 
I would recommend avoiding the TV effect transition and instead doing a jump cut between from a close up of Matthew reacting to the crash or during the aftermath to Matthew’s close up sitting in the living room with a blank face and using the audio from the commercial to then reveal the shot of the TV and the change of location and Mom. Also why did we lose the line of Matthew deciding to get a job?
How come this scene with Rez and Julie is not where it was in the script? It seems like it would fit more within the post club night sequences of each one of them at their houses after the club. Did you try and opted for this? 
Can we please have more sky and streets and IRELAND!?
Rez dialog at the night of his suicide attempt was great in giving him more presence as well as building up his arc explaining the breakup with Julie to a more impactful climax with the suicide attempt. Also it was another good moment with Jen. Generally Jen’s presence in the film as connection to “reality” and wisdom is very beneficial. Would try to include more if possible. 
Would consider losing the TV with Kearney in America from the Tattoo scene. Back to the general comment that when it is each of the characters moments they should not let the others invade too much. 
The montage worked great in a previous cut. Is there a hybrid between that montage and what we have now? 
When Matthew is looking at the footage from Kearney’s visit to America is the only moment in which the channel change static effect is justified and even then should it technically would it not be the typical blue screen or black from the camera? Would opt for removing it as much as possible and doing clean cuts instead. In this instance in particular I would use something more realistic going from the image and quickly using an RGB channel phase fade or pixellate to and from the camera generated blue or black giving it a more tape-like cut. Camera interface overlay like you have for the security cameras?
The cut from Matthew’s arrival to Jen’s house over to the bedroom is a tad abrupt. I like the effect that it has now given the change of pace but just a bit more at the entrance should actually accentuate it more. 
The build up to these trippy moments when Matthew is high and trying to get with Jen needs the audio and-or visual cue/motif as well as a rethinking of the execution. Cool that the TV triggers it and that is the device where it is seen through at times but maybe breaking into full screen  more often with the footage and to do that consistently across all the TV reality trips will make them more impactful and will make it cleaner. The TV triggers it but seen directly for too long through the TV takes away from the impact of the moments and the imagery. 
Security Camera again above Jens room. Why? Is this to transmit a feeling of being watched?
Avoid split screens please. 
At the end of the scene on the bus with all three of them on the way to the party would you stay on Kearney for one or two more seconds after the “suicide watch” joke to get more of the gesture of Kearney handing Rez the Oxy?
These temporal cuts as Kearney sets up his drugs at the party seems very fitting within the language of the film as the visual side of the audio and-or visual cue/motif that corresponds to the surreal moments. Maybe try applying them in those moments more uniformly to see how they play?
Why is Rez’s conclusion with Julie missing?
At the final party I would skip the shot of the guys walking over to the furniture and go direct to them sitting down… the empty furniture makes the whole party feel empty.

     MISSING? SCENES
The flight and arrival to America needs to be reshot or redesigned but I feel that it is missing. 
Rez and Julie in the park? The break up and motivation for the suicide attempt?
Is there more left out from the TV Reality storyline that could be included back in?

     *01:01:35:05*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      Generally I feel the scene would benefit from more close ups as well as more squeezing out the really uncomfortable silences… especially the last one before Landerton gets up. 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:01:48:17*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      Would add even more cuts using more of the great footage of that walk down the stairs. But I would start them later. To the music even. Let it build in frequency. Beginning of temporal cuts that repeat later in the film? Maybe even skip the beginning when he opens the door. 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      I would start with a shot of Matthew in front of the water to establish where he is now catching the action a few seconds before the first time we see it currently. Then cutting to Kearney for the first time walking around the corner so we can appreciate his reaction and assume he knows him before they talk.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:03:40:00*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      Is there anything to extend the church scene slightly?

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:03:45:09*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">

      This is where you introduce the channel flipping transition as well as the security camera pov for the first time. This is more of a general comment but normally we prefer to get to a content cut before applying any transitions or filters so as to not get too distracted. With regards to the reasoning and logic behind the TV channel change and in general our parallel TV universe I feel there needs to be a more consistent logic or identification of when it comes in and out. When they are hungover, or drunk, or in America, or getting a tattoo, or feeling guilty? There should be an audio and/or visual cue to take us there and when it happens there needs to be a puzzle for us to solve as an audience. Why and when do these happen and what am I seeing?

     *01:06:15:06*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      That same audio and/or visual cue could be present at this moment as well. When Matthew reacts to Rez jumping in on the destruction.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:10:20:19*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      Notwithstanding the comment about the filters and graphics I do really like the concept with which you have treated the club scene. The only exception being the freeze frames. 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:10:42:14*

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      This banter is great. Is there more of it that you would consider could be added back into the film? 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:11:20:14*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      The first proper introduction of the story device. Honestly would skip the parents being in the TV and would stick to the Leads and the TV Show characters being the only ones that carry over to that realm.

      Here we have the security camera angle again. Why is this here? How does this all connect with the TV realm? 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:15:19:03*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      This audio right now is a great example of the audio and/or visual cue I was mentioning as well as a good moment for it. 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:18:38:15*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      Would recommend losing the zooms and quick movements and sticking to all the great slomo reactions and movements from the actors to express the horror of the moment until the Mother’s scream brings us back to real time. I would extend both the lead up to the crash and the aftermath almost bringing in the motif so we don’t go so sudden from the Drugs music like a PSA. 
I would recommend avoiding the TV effect transition and instead doing a jump cut between from a close up of Matthew reacting to the crash or during the aftermath to Matthew’s close up sitting in the living room with a blank face and using the audio from the commercial to then reveal the shot of the TV and the change of location and Mom. Also why did we lose the line of Matthew deciding to get a job?
Did we not shoot the material with the cops after the car crash scene?

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:21:41:18*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      How come this scene with Rez and Julie is not where it was in the script? It seems like it would fit more within the post club night each one at their house sequence back at 01:11:20:00-01:13:40:16. Did you try and opted for this? 
01:21:07:08 Even though I would try to have this play earlier I would still extend it back to include all the dialog to include the Trix are for Kids part. 
01:21:10:22 Not only referring to time lapse or this shot in particular but YEAAAAAA!!! Can we please have more sky and streets and IRELAND!?
01:29:36:23 Rez dialog here was great in giving him more presence as well as building up his arc explaining the breakup with Julie to a more impactful climax with the suicide attempt. Also it was another good moment with Jen. Generally Jen’s presence in the film as connection to “reality” and wisdom is very beneficial. Would try to include more if possible. 
01:32:08:18 I would lose the TV with Kearney in America from the Tattoo scene. Back to the general comment that when it is each of the characters moments they should not let the others invade too much. 
01:32:51:19 Maybe the sound of the crash which should be the protagonist in that actual crash scene should be what creates the impact and recalls the memory of the moment in the viewer. With that sound it is plenty to wake up Matthew from his nightmare skipping the dolly over from the girl sitting on the bed. 
01:37:46:22 YEAAAA!!!
01:38:13:00 Is there a way to make this montage longer and get more out of it? Almost letting the full song play out fully over that by adding more dialogue and mini situations out of the scenes used in the montage and letting Kearney’s arrival happen after a much clearer cut when the song ends? Back to my general comment regarding the passage of time there is a time-lapse in the script at this moment and to have it be more of an interruption that contrasts between the “without Kearney” days and the start or return of something else that is not the Matthew/Jen montage. It’s own song/sound?
01:40:47:07 This is the only moment in which the channel change static effect is justified and even then should it technically would it not be the typical blue screen or black from the camera? Would opt for removing it as much as possible and doing clean cuts instead. In this instance in particular I would use something more realistic going from the image and quickly using an RGB channel phase fade or pixellate to and from the camera generated blue or black giving it a more tape-like cut. Camera interface overlay?
01:42:19:03 The cut from Matthew’s arrival to the bedroom is a tad abrupt. I like the effect that it has now given the change of pace but just a bit more at the entrance should actually accentuate it more.

The TV triggers it but seen directly for too long takes away from the impact of the moment and the imagery. 
1:45:02:16 Security Camera again. Why? This is the kind of overlay I would use on Kearney’s camera footage btw. Is this to transmit a feeling of being watched?
01:46:55:21 A great moment for the audio and/or visual cue.
Around here the lack of some establishing shots and concept of passage of time is especially present.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *01:57:27:02*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      These are both too good to be split. Cut between them please. 

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Oblique; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     *02:00:55:05*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      / 1:54:33:00 Stay on Kearney for one more second to get more of the gesture of handing Rez the Oxy.
01:55:39:20 These temporal cuts seem very fitting within the language of the film as the visual side of the audio and/or visual cue for the surreal moments. Maybe try applying them in those moments more uniformly to see how they play?
02:00:02:22 Please no flashback. Not necessary. Actually the shot that followed Matthew out from the party was really cool and is barely appreciated currently. See, hear and feel more of the emotional impact no need to recap. 
Why is Rez’s conclusion with Julie missing?
02:05:05:23 This snapping for the jump of the gun to Kearney’s hand also played well within the atemporal cutting concept. Are there other moments in which he snaps that can be used to drive this home?
02:05:28:07 Would prefer a clean cut instead of the split screen if possible. 
02:06:02:19 Wh ere is Kearney calling from? He’s already back.
02:06:47:12 Great example of spatial and temporal establishment. 
02:12:22:17 If you actually don’t see the girl those previous times like I mentioned above this time when you see her so clearly it will bug you out even more. 
02:15:29:09 I would skip this shot and go direct to them sitting down… the empty furniture makes the whole party feel empty.
