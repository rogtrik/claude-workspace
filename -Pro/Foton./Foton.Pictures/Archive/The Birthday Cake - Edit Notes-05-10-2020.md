     Leo’s side of the calls are a great place to provide more clarity if we use every opportunity. Particularly the very first call still at Gio’s apt. Beyond that, would consider the idea of Father Kelly VO but would make it more like a single confessional with young Gio or something like that instead of direct flashbacks or narration. Maybe it is Leo’s confession and it plays late in the film?
Beyond these two spots as places to possibly work with the broader things that we discussed and agreed during the call like any added clarity with regards to the stakes or about the dynamic between Gio and Leo but without affecting the current structure.
The audio is very bad and the subtitles hurt a little bit. Hope that you guys are able to get a good ADR session with him and be able to get a much better capture of the electrolarynx in a studio. Also we could use the breathing more purposefully when we do ADR w Val as another way to add tension. 
There are like 2 moments that seem to be abrupt cuts or mistakes with the encode or stream so would rather try to catch them on next viewing. 
This is the movie we set out to make and I am beyond proud of what it is. Happy to keep viewing and perfecting but do not share any idea of changing this into something else. 
Love the music. Before getting too attached where are we in the edit process with that? As in how much of it is temp or placeholder and how much is locked?
Is there anything that can be included from what was shot that might show how close to his death Gio got? Anything that the two randos that show up were doing? 
I do not think we have structural issues or broad pacing issues. They actually fluctuate and in general I seem to feel it more in the second half of the film. I probably missed a couple of versions of the cut in between the ones I got to see and I found myself feeling like I was missing things in this one but don’t remember what it is and can’t refer to the previous link. I am of the idea that the pacing is not a runtime thing but an acceleration deceleration thing so if applicable maybe would try to not remove things in favor of pacing but instead just accentuate the accel and decel moments and actually bringing stuff back in (if it makes sense of course) will even make it feel like more is happening in the same amount of time and help the pacing. 

————————
00:38:48 - There are a lot of “Gio”s. Can ONE* of them be cut out or cut around? 
00:57:47 - Do you have any coverage of the bag that is clearer to see. So we understand it’s the same bag when he hands it to Ricardo. 
01:15:50 - Should add a “Chocolate this year” ADR line. Otherwise they would all know Gio is allergic and can’t have any. 
01:18:32 - Guy dying in the Christmas tree is comical and we should be out of this whole thing by this point. 
01:26:25 - Is there any coverage of his wound so we can understand its fatal? He managed to stay alive this long. Gio even asks “where are you hurt?”. And his death is really anti-climactic — music is not selling this. 
01:30:41 - Fr. Kelly’s monologue about contradictions is not landing for me. It’s not tied to a theme in the film. Mom told him she wants him to grow up, Fr. Kelly only told him things were going to change in the “young Gio” scene, it’s been 10 years since then so we need to have a resolution that is fueled by the mother’s motivation. Some scripture or something that summarizes what we’ve just seen and justifies a priest and mother orchestrating a mass murder.

Explore ways to understand Gio’s inner struggle more. One version of this could be to start at the house and then use the Leo/gun scene, and Fr. Kelly scenes as flashbacks. These could be done as Gio walks through the neighborhood on his way to Angelos. These could also be done with Fr. Kelly VOs over them if you need to tell more story in them. Or even Gio giving confessionals to Fr. Kelly about what happened in the memory we are flashing back to. “Forgive me Father for I have sinned…Leo said it would be fine but I shouldn’t have taken the gun…” etc., things that build the story between Leo and Gio so that we really understand who Leo is by the time we find him dying in the bathtub.

     *Alternate Cut 3*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     
Use confessionals or homily’s with Fr. Kelly as chapter headings — make them thematic to what we’re about to see. Moses Crossing the Red Sea as Gio traverses across town to Angelo’s, etc. The betrayal of Judas, and so on. And finally wrap it up with Fr. Kelly in the church bringing it to a resolution that justifies his actions. 
In any event, the point is that we need to clarify the themes in the film, build the stakes from the get, understand Gio’s inner struggle more, and arrive at a more satisfying inner arc resolution for Gio that will probably come from Fr. Kelly and his mother explaining what they’ve done in some fashion and why.
