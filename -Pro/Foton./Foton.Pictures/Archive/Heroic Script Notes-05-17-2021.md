Formatting hiccups and fragments in english, as well as weird repetition of action lines made me wonder in what direction the translating actually went at times. 
Reminds me a lot of HATYM in that it faces the concept of toxic masculinity without leaving much with the viewer and our protagonist beyond this is the way it is and it sucks but it is so. The climax was strangely not as satisfying as I was expecting (same as HATYM) and you can tell the rape scene was tweaked between a man/woman being the victim which makes me wonder as to why… If the victim is indeed a man, I am not sure what the repressed gay villain really adds to good representation on screen.
The concept of masculinity and what it can mean today and towards the future is a fascinating, timely and important theme to me which makes me want to like this but in the end I do not think that it delivers fully. 
Intrigued to see if the director or writer were actually in the military or come from military families and particularly indigenous people within the Mexican military for this to really drive it home. Would much prefer to have the mole agent version of this than to just simply shove fictional shocking situations in people’s faces as that is not too conducive to change. 
Also I think it will be very limited in its reach which makes the unattractive sales numbers make a lot of sense and I do not see the possibility of working w Michel Franco as something that can beat out all the points against this.
