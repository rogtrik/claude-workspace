# Vandal Notes Dec 1


P1
i would still like to see the emotional transition in Pharo before he jams the gun under his chin. It needs to go from in the zone happiness of having completed his piece and transition back to his reality of not having much more to give the world. BANG

P3
Nick is in his late 20s

P4 
The Chino bitches joke lost power in the punchline.

P5
Clarify the toy reference to rookies or wannabes

I liked that before Nick just signaled to Blaze... If we want him to talk I would change dialogue to yo blaze to establish the characters name.

If we find it interesting we could clarify bomb as military reference.

P10
Clarify THAT GUY Sizmik...

P13 
The tough guy thing gets repetitive.

P16
Neither one of US have gotten a lick of sleep...

P21 
Nick is not sarcastic with that comment.

P25
Hospital and cementary needs work… more than the name of the guns it is the places he was offering to send him to

P29
I would expand the last exhange btn nick and michael

P41 
Nicks explanation still needs to be more baller and revealing to crack Silks armor.

P44
Silk should come up with something to make up for her loss for words. She is sharper than that.

P45
Weird how he drops off blaze and in the next scene they are together again. Sense of time is something that still needs to be worked.

Still dont like the balloon... Are we even analyzing other options?

P47
And the universal symbol line no longer applies to balloon...

P49 
Nice dissertation

P50
Liked it better when Sizmik got cracked mid laugh.

P54
Silks "I bet" is off for the moment.

P63
Why would nick take pics of the mural?

What happens to the line "this stays buffed until the beef is settled." It was badass.

P65
Why is nick dropping the wisdom now instead of his brother. This talk is way too short now. More wisdom from Michael. For a good performer we need interesting characters.

P66 
The stills concept is cheesy.

P85 
Michael inciting violence?




Feel the stakes more. What is always at play with what they chose to do. It is ilegal. 

More connection w Blaze. Justify all the reactions when he dies. We talked about maybe expanding the scene where blazes mom ignoring their arrival to her actually engaging nick telling him how much blaze looks up to him.

More bakgnd w Pharo. Not history. Feel why his connection with everyone and his example to the central plot for nick.

Emotional transitions very abrupt. 

Loft scenes are a little cheesy...

Sizmik still cartoonish. 

Nick trying to be too cool... See more bulnerable side... W Silk? Lipman?

Enough bro moments. No need to punch those up any more.

Silk much better... Need to see a little more awkwardness. Seeing the player not knowing this new game.

The doubt of jumping sides and the repercussions of their actions and their love. This is very important but it is limited explicitly to what is said during the Vice doc.

I still think it should be during the credits. Shorten.
