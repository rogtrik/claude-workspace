Hi Maggie and thank you very much for taking the time to connect today… I did not know you were EST… are you based in NY or are you visiting?
With the intention of setting the right tone for this call I would like to preface this talk with clarifying that I have zero intention of negotiating any of the proposed terms re WME’s package fee. 
We are in complete agreement and very appreciative of the market environment that WME was able to conjure up with its relationships and value creating methods that we are fortunately very familiar with and how that translated to us being able to get this project with the right partner and at a healthy budget level. 
The intention of this call is more for us to walk through how this very organic process came to happen and evolved along the way to where it is now and for both of us to hear the other on how we see things moving forward. 


So now to rebuild some kind of timeline and what was on my a sequence of misunderstandings…
Commission from Alex, Kareem, and what was my misunderstanding Mario. 
Then it was our misunderstanding from your letter that the 10% fee could apply to our producer fee on the project which was later clarified. 
and last but not least and what I would love to understand a bit more is how things can go so quickly from the conversation with our counsel on terms to a threat on your part to hold up this deal after all the work that has been done and to the possible detriment of your clients who we are actually in conversations to become one as well. 


Beyond ALL of this and with the clarity of today in which I understand that this sale corresponds to an agreement between you and my company that we had never had the chance to talk one on one and here we are. 
Moving fwd will you guys continue this amazing energy that has gotten here and negotiate the Long-Form with us? What else can we expect from WME moving fwd with Gigante?
