Genesis Ending Script Read Apr 17

P1
First scene could be developed further. Currently it's pure suspense and no real story.

Add ages to all the character descriptions

Consistency and repetition will be required to establish all these new terms like Fu Bai. Its use in page 3 seems like it means fuck or "how bad"

P4 
Why does Ajax say we can't do that?

P5
Moon to earth takes 1.3 secs. We can use these delays as a story device here and in later situations.

Their cockiness lessens the importance and risk of the mission. This emotional kissing moment should happen earlier off their relief of avoiding the drones and since they are still hiding can have that moment. Anything after seems sloppy and distracted.

Stasis Deposit? You mean Depot or Warehouse?

Start stressing the possibility of tipping off the enemy if they communicate to often... to justify the mistake made by the programmer later.

I would see the programmer younger here. Like a child prodigy. At least he comes off as such. Almost childish.

Dialogue needs polish. Can do a pass through this week. 

P7
It should have been no smiles the whole time. Now they should be scared shitless but they are cool under the pressure. 

P8 this Dali Greco interaction is much cooler. 

P10
I would have him begin recording again as soon as he finishes the last exchange with Dali as he is about to turn the cloaking back on... In this instance we could have the footsteps on the ground or something give away that he is there through the Moons feed of the POV... we wont be able to see these details if he is cloaked anyways.

P11 make the pause AFTER "...mortal enemy,..."

And I would have Ishtar point at the moon. What better enemy to unite under than one that is staring at you almost every night. 

P23 if the posessed Apkallu have white eyes why are they black when Lukyan reawakens in the crater scene.

P32 Ties some knots not clear.

P45 explain the ships neural link at the top of the scene so you can then understand Dali and Progs connection.

P47 Say Dali or refer to her directly when Ajax confronts the programmer about being responsible for almost killing everyone. 

P55 Ishtar is with the Apkallu or on radio? Why would she find out about things that are absorbed by Saturnus if they are not connected.

P56 is this flashback in the right place?

P58 speed of light would take 80 minutes from saturn to the sun... maybe save this delay for when the ship breaks down?

P63 you would make a great cheesy

P65 flip the good mom good person line from eyra

P67 when di Ghost never stop talking?
