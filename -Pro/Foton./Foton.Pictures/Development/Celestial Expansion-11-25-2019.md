Generational divide between two universes.

Almost playing up the late boomer / X / Millenial.

The gift of the industrial revolution is the computer revolution and that is what replaces or our old belief framework in the new Universe with the technological foe that we ourselves create and must learn to use wisely. That is what goes out of control in the previous universe just like it unknowingly happened in the realm of Genesis Ending and is still unfinished business into the new universe.

The Natives will represent the new Universe and the core of CW. It will be them and speak to them. The origin stories will feel futuristic yet almost nostalgic to how they grew up and our now able to have strength to face the unfinished business of the past universe as well as carve a path for a new one.
