What is this recurring mention of a virtual universe. Does this mean the Celestial Weapons universe is virtual or that it was just one route things could have gone?

## #business

We would create an SPC for this development that will be owned by Foton Pictures. We could call it Mythallogy LLC. Is this something that you can do for us or should I ask corp lawyers to do this? Now that we are on the subject, most of our LLCs are due for their annual reports. That is something that our corp lawyers used to handle but with the intention of handling all matters with you is this something you can handle as well?

Then Mythallogy LLC will create Celestial Multiverse LLC. It will have two partners. Mythallogy will be the controlling partner with 51% of the company and 49% will belong to the LLC that our friends in Mexico will have to create.

So we would need a simple OA for Mythallogy and a more complex one for Celestial Multiverse. 

In the Celestial Multiverse OA first and foremost they will transfer all ownership of the IP of their original work but clarifying that what is being created is a completely new work and a work for hire fully owned by the new entity. They would have no claim over the work created beyond their specific participation as partners in the LLC.

I would like to include certain protections for our partners in which we would do our best to keep Luis Bernal as writer of the script and potentially director but it is understood between the parties that we will look for the true best option in both cases and that it will not necessarily be Luis Bernal. Not sure what kind of additional protections we can provide for them but there needs to be a feeling a true partnership in the project although we have complete control over the LLC and the IP. In the extreme scenario that during the process of development and eventual production of the project we decide to remove them from any active involvement they would still retain their economic participation moving forward. 

Then Celestial Multiverse will enter into a work for hire agreement with Luis Bernal and Cesar xxxxx (missing last name) for the research, development and writing necessary for the Celestial Trilogy feature films with the working titles:

A New God
