# An Advocate / Crossing Hitler



## Wrap Up Reasoning

- The entertainment industry and the independent film market continues to heavily impacted in recent years and have not recovered as expected after the strikes ended.
- Although limited when compared to just a couple of years ago we do believe that there is opportunity in the episodic space through effective partnering and coproduction something that could benefit this project specifically.
- Notwithstanding our wanting to pursue turning An Advocate into an episodic project, we believe that Laura is one of the best producers in the game and her vision and plan to get this made with Thomás will result in a beautiful film worthy of awards recognition and that will have the impact for social awareness we’ve always hoped this film would achieve.
- Laura has a great plan with strong financing partners in Germany that will combine with her own production financing capabilities and Thomás is ready for a 2026 production start!
