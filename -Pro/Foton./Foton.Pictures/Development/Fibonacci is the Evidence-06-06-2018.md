# Fibonacci is the Evidence

 <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     God as a person is a a human characterization. All is one. One is all and fibonacci is the evidence... from galaxies, to hurricanes to freaky veggies all the way down to toilets flushing. Why are they all the same, how are they all connected.

Is beauty part of life or is life the witness of all beauty.
