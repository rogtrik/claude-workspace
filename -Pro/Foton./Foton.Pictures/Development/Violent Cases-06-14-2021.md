Enjoyed the Novel but was appreciative of it in a whole new level after watching it a second time. Mike is simply an amazing storyteller. 
There is an inherent trippyness and particular visual style to Dave McKean’s illustrations in the novel. Got to see a couple of the films he directed and it is extremely complicated to execute it well while being strictly loyal to look of his illustrations. 
Osteopath’s 3 iterations will al be played by same actor and make any changes necessary through make up?
Would it be your intention for Neil to play “the personality” in the film?
