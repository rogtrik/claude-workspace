      is that of the digital realm and cyberspace. The place where live streams, autonomous driving systems, videogame worlds and TikTok all exist.

     *physical world*
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     , yet they are accepted by humanity as concrete and very real aspects of life. 
We imagine this series to take place in a time when social media apps and games are virtual worlds that we have completely accepted as real — unified with normal life rather than separate from it. A world in which the lines separating these realities have disappeared and we are left with a subtle unease, a feeling that something is not quite right, not quite real, even though our senses will no longer be able to tell the difference and our minds might not even want to.
To the naked eye, this world could look a lot like ours. No flying cars, no Aliens walking around. However, this is a society where intimate technology now dominates and becomes the lens through which we experience “reality”. The continued advancement of AI and robotics have lead to a societal upheaval and has created an existential threat or opportunity to those who are now part of the largest unemployed population in human history. But any trace of this stark reality is veiled and supported by technology and human optimism. This is not a post apocalyptic or depressing portrait of society. This our hopes, our dreams and our stubbornness towards accepting any kind reality and the way our minds, even without technological assistance, can distort our perception. 
Looking for answers, comfort and purpose, this could be a story that celebrates human resilience. A world that excels in recreating the “natural” to the point of being indistinguishable from reality, creates immense opportunity to no longer need to escape into a virtual world, but instead merge it with our own. A world that is seductive, addictive and at the constant risk of being imperceptibly manipulated. Who and what can you even begin to truly trust? A vacuum in society that the concept of faith can feed. Not only faith like in ancient religions in which an even greater existence beyond our own can give us the answers. This is a world in which a hyper stimulated heaven-like experience can be had with a software update. We could treat faith more as the underlying peace of mind that we all share, given the fact that what we know as true, actually is. 
We imagine a story that lives between worlds and then blurs any difference between them. In its first episodes we could even stay mostly in an entirely digital, lifelike video game world, meeting our characters through their avatars, or the ideal of how each person would like others to perceive them. From this world, we could begin to see glimpses of the physical world, exploring the possible contrasts of our characters’ avatars and their “true self”. As the series progresses a certain technological breakthrough pushes us to this new age in which these hyper realistic video game worlds spill out of cyberspace and become part of our waking, sunlight-soaked world.
This could be a series with bilingual storylines and could present a completely unique and new aesthetic that can take us past cyberpunk saturation, to the much more visually malleable and socially relevant hopepunk. We imagine a series that initially navigates between the US and Latin America like the triple frontier; a potent mix of class differences, tech and immigration. A globalized world in which to explore a clear power imbalance under the complicity of corrupt government/corporate structures and occupied lands. A dispute of economic, technological, and natural resources. One that explores a fragile and complicated interdependent coexistence.
Uncanny Valley could combine a big sci-fi universe with the intimate struggles of unique and multi layered characters. A world that could feel as high concept as a less dim Westworld or the OA but one that savors and explores grounded personal conflicts like in a virtually embellished Euphoria or True Detective.

THEMES
A possible exploration of the bond between addiction, technology and power. 
We could see Geopolitics playing out in multiple planes of “reality”.
Experimenting with a futurist society from both the individual and collective standpoint.
A confrontation of our own unreliable narratives; an exploration into the prismatic nature of perception.
Above all, we imagine this show not necessarily as a cautionary tale on technology or government control, but as a mystery that needs to be solved; trying to answer what is actually real while amplifying what we can grasp onto to continue being hopeful of tomorrow.
The popularity of massive multiplayer online (MMO) gaming is exploding at the same time that the technology to access persistent virtual worlds with hyper realistic graphics from nearly any device is becoming available. As of 2021, we are already at the first corner of this block that can provide a new and fresh landscape to bring authentic and compelling characters to life.
