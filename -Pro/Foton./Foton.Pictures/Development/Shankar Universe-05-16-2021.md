Congrats on Guardians of Justice

So we have had an eye on this for some time and would like to have it under consideration for one last time to do the whole thing together.

Understand that it is currently only animation. 

Hyper Light Breaker News… angle? style of animation? We really like this direction. Do you guys see this as a possibility? 
Collabo vibe was one of the things we appreciated the most about this. 
550k is the latest all in amount for about 22min of animation split into short episodes. 
Idea is to flip to netflix at around 2X return with a series commitment. Series is also short eps or move to more traditional runtime?

With regards to IP and for clarity sake all AV rights are currently held securely by Bootleg and we would co-own the new work and all it exploitation and its derivatives. 
Is there a possibility of buying into that existing Bootleg - HeartMachine deal now or in the future?

ANGRY METAL execute this aesthetic well?
