     **Draft Notes Oct 20 2017**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Mourning the dead and speeches are way too prevalent.
What is the objective of Dali and Greco’s mission? If it was surveillance why di he have to go in? When his intelligence is celebrated p53 it is almost comedic.
Detailed descriptions and structural issues are still affecting pace
p16 Eyra doesn’t trust anything with a cable in it but she is a pilot?
P20 Evolution and Science is not what she stands for... 
why are Makia and Eyra embarrassed of their relationship?
Achim still comes off as childish and a little bit of a bitch.
The “romantic” instances between him and Dali are cheesy
Replacing the dead husband thing is still weird to me
Wars sale joke is stupid and overused
Eyra’s racism comes off as so ridiculous.
Everyone seems disposable at times.
Eyra’s death after Makia’s is way too much. 
P94 nonsensical fragments like “Even GHOST is amazingly quiet in comparison to the rest of the trip, when it usually didn't stop talking. ” when there were probably three lines from ghost thus far at the most.
P96 horrendously sloppy full of repetition, misspelled characters and fragments. Sperm fertilizing the gg and many others.

Genesis Ending Script Read Apr 17 2017
P1 First scene could be developed further. Currently it's pure suspense and no real story.
Add ages to all the character descriptions
Consistency and repetition will be required to establish all these new terms like Fu Bai. Its use in page 3 seems like it means fuck or "how bad"
P4 Why does Ajax say we can't do that?
P5 Moon to earth takes 1.3 secs. We can use these delays as a story device here and in later situations.
Their cockiness lessens the importance and risk of the mission. This emotional kissing moment should happen earlier off their relief of avoiding the drones and since they are still hiding can have that moment. Anything after seems sloppy and distracted.
Stasis Deposit? You mean Depot or Warehouse?
Start stressing the possibility of tipping off the enemy if they communicate to often... to justify the mistake made by the programmer later.
I would see the programmer younger here. Like a child prodigy. At least he comes off as such. Almost childish.
Dialogue needs polish. Can do a pass through this week. 
P7 It should have been no smiles the whole time. Now they should be scared shitless but they are cool under the pressure. 
P8 this Dali Greco interaction is much cooler. 
P10 I would have him begin recording again as soon as he finishes the last exchange with Dali as he is about to turn the cloaking back on... In this instance we could have the footsteps on the ground or something give away that he is there through the Moons feed of the POV... we wont be able to see these details if he is cloaked anyways.
P11 make the pause AFTER "...mortal enemy,..."
And I would have Ishtar point at the moon. What better enemy to unite under than one that is staring at you almost every night. 
P23 if the posessed Apkallu have white eyes why are they black when Lukyan reawakens in the crater scene.
P32 Ties some knots not clear.
P45 explain the ships neural link at the top of the scene so you can then understand Dali and Progs connection.
P47 Say Dali or refer to her directly when Ajax confronts the programmer about being responsible for almost killing everyone.
P55 Ishtar is with the Apkallu or on radio? Why would she find out about things that are absorbed by Saturnus if they are not connected.
P56 is this flashback in the right place?
P58 speed of light would take 80 minutes from saturn to the sun... maybe save this delay for when the ship breaks down?
P63 you would make a great cheesy
P65 flip the good mom good person line from eyra
P67 when di Ghost never stop talking?

2017 First AI is created.

2035 Nanotechnology and cyborg advancements have lead to common use of the technologies in our daily lives. 

2070 Most advanced AI is installed in the world’s first use of quantic computing, the super computer Helios I. Given the energy needs of the supercomputer it is installed. 

2090 Helios I achieves presence and omniscience in hyperspace and once this is detected by humanity they decide to shut down Helios I 

Nihilism and pragmatism overruns way of thought as 

The end of humanity but not humans. 

The universe has gone cold.

What is this recurring mention of a virtual universe. Does this mean the Celestial Weapons universe is virtual or that it was just one route things could have gone?

     **Business**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     We would create an SPC for this development that will be owned by Foton Pictures. We could call it Mythallogy LLC. Is this something that you can do for us or should I ask corp lawyers to do this? Now that we are on the subject, most of our LLCs are due for their annual reports. That is something that our corp lawyers used to handle but with the intention of handling all matters with you is this something you can handle as well?
Then Mythallogy LLC will create Celestial Multiverse LLC. It will have two partners. Mythallogy will be the controlling partner with 51% of the company and 49% will belong to the LLC that our friends in Mexico will have to create.
So we would need a simple OA for Mythallogy and a more complex one for Celestial Multiverse. 
In the Celestial Multiverse OA first and foremost they will transfer all ownership of the IP of their original work but clarifying that what is being created is a completely new work and a work for hire fully owned by the new entity. They would have no claim over the work created beyond their specific participation as partners in the LLC.
I would like to include certain protections for our partners in which we would do our best to keep Luis Bernal as writer of the script and potentially director but it is understood between the parties that we will look for the true best option in both cases and that it will not necessarily be Luis Bernal. Not sure what kind of additional protections we can provide for them but there needs to be a feeling a true partnership in the project although we have complete control over the LLC and the IP. In the extreme scenario that during the process of development and eventual production of the project we decide to remove them from any active involvement they would still retain their economic participation moving forward. 
Then Celestial Multiverse will enter into a work for hire agreement with Luis Bernal and Cesar xxxxx (missing last name) for the research, development and writing necessary for the Celestial Trilogy feature films with the working titles:

A New God
Celestial 1
Celestial 2
