El Ultimo Lugar by Hector Feliciano
Summary and Coverage done by Noe

At first sight this a kind of story that we have seen many times in the past. Covering both Nazi stolen art (Monuments Men) as well as forgeries of masterpieces.
On the other hand, heist stories can be greatly entertaining and seem to have evergreen relevance. Art heist stories are specifically relevant today with Lupin as an example.
The WW2 era and Nazi element tends to work well with audiences but has become a bit more tired as of late.
Latino in Paris and in general the Latino Perspective is what provides our freshness within a busy thematic space.
We would have to heavily manipulate the story. Focusing it, upping the thrills, and in the case of a film hype focus on Twin Painting mystery or in the case of a series  broadening the scope beyond Nazis and possibly deviating from the true story aspect we consider valuable. 
Most importantly stories on screen are built on character and we would need to truly connect wit this journalist we know very little about except regarding his lovers. If he could become the Rene Russo character from Thomas Crowne affair we could have a good starting point.

/“tomar como eje central “Las señoritas de aviñon” y desde ahí, rearmar el guión para no fugar la atención y logra generar intriga.  Enfocar en la posibilidad de un gemelo, darle lugar a los viajes, a las entrevistas y sobre todo a este periodista del que casi no conocemos su historia excepto a sus novias.  Convertirlo a él como a la Rene Russo de “The Thomas Crown Affair”./
/Creo que con esos ajustes, se puede lograr tanto un film como una interesante serie que nos invite al recorrido del arte, el amor, la guerra y la muerte.”/

This would have better chances being born as a French production accessing incentives and core perspective. Need to be clear if perspective of Latino in paris is not excluding for traditionally patriotic French audiences. 

The storyline we find most interesting is Las Señoritas De Aviñon and that investigation.
The loves story is superfluous at times and would heed to be intertwined much more to justify it being there.
