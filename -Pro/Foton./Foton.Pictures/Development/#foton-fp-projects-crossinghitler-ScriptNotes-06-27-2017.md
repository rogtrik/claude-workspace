Would help to add relative time to time jumps.
p1 how would you read the Little Rabbit rhyme? What is the reference?  
p15 Love “What kind of man you’re going to be when no one is looking”
p17 the bear thing is a bit strong and in general the animal references make Margot come off as childish. (Clarified during the call but maybe it is a matter of frequency or manner)
p17 Alternative to “It’s called growing up.”? 
p17 Are the nicknames real? The exchange here regarding Ursa major and their nicknames is a bit on the nose regarding their dynamic and feeds this borderline childish perspective from Margot that does not correspond with her “ambition and intelligence beyond her years” nature. It is a hell of a way to transition the conversation and I do like that we touch on the subject of Hans being into all of Max’s girls and how the scene continues but I think through the action even up to just this point the tension in this triangle is definitely clear. As counterpoint to how Margot is perceived could it be a thin line between transmitting Innocence vs Idealism?
p27 I like the note of them being characteristically colder in their interactions as a family. On the other hand we are jumping right into this scene at a high point in the discussion and it does seem completely justified. I also really like this scene almost form a rite of passage process that Hans is going through. 
p28 Sauerbraten can be brilliant? I have been missing out. 
p30 this more nuanced hints of his obsession/love for her I think go better than the very direct ones. Let the tension and suspicion build in the audience instead of confirming it outright.
Make Max less aware or at least more in denial of the triangle. He seems overly aware of it at times. 
p31 what is this suicide scene doing here? Are we killing Hans the boy? 
Flash forwards are messing with the flow of the story. Or are they?
p41 What’s the reasoning behind this prison camp scene? Enforce the surprise of his betrayal later or just show Hans thawing?
p47 Seems like Margot cools off a bit too quickly. 
p49 Line in the sand seems a bit soft to me… is it particularly german? 
p57 “rudderless” seems too personal… compared to unemployed or uneducated that is more  society’s fault. I love the point of showing this time in German history and highlighting the parallels to other countries’ histories that used populist tactics which in the end took advantage of an uneducated, unemployed and impoverished people. The evilness of nazis is clear and has been shown in film so many times.  Kind of became a general note along the way…
p57 I still feel Margot should still be pissed at him or at least having changed her demeanor slightly towards him…. or has the rush of the danger taken over the fact of how “stupid” it was to send her in on her own to the SA bar? And here he once again acts like an asshole at the end of the scene. 
p61 Becker: The SA feels betrayed or was betrayed?
p64 maybe here is where Margot can let up since she is so blown away by the fact that they will indeed be able to get Hitler into the courtroom.
p64/65 Prison scene could lose some of the fat…
p67 “Considering you just walked in with it, I’ll the hazard the guess: No.” unlikable. 
p68 Margot finally peeved indeed. 
p70 Please explain the little rabbit thing. Does not translate too well in my opinion. 
p83 “Yet anyway. (then) But it strikes me as odd…” Reads weird.
p87 More and more leaning towards diminishing the prison scenes but there is a lot of meat on those bones. Would we be looking for a place to plant Hans’ regrets, doubts and immortal romanticism in the court timeline if the prison scenes are removed?
p89 “it just… Im pregnant.” really?
p105 freaky stalker shit (calling the hospital)
p105 The reichstag or a more generic term? As in congress/parliament and then go to the proper reichstag when it is mentioned again but the first impact should be generic IMHO
p109 outright admitting her love for Hans to Max and he’s just chillin to the point of caving in on his position? 
I am very conflicted with the prison scenes. Less fat than I had imagined before this read and really feel that they are essential for the current structure of the script. I believe pushing all to the end would be anti climactic and the change would entail a more complete reworking of the story structure for it to maintain its effectiveness.  If it ain’t broke…
