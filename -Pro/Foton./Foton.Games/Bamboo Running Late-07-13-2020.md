Sonido o animación al agarrar el item del nivel? El pedido
Autopausa al salir del app?
Sigo sin ver alguna animación para el slide… sera q lo comuniqué de manera poco clara?
Have collectibles do something? Bongos could be new music.
I would reconsider the wheel of fortune at the start of every level. Would almost make it a choice or force it at the en of the level not the beginning. It really negates the concept of hitting a button that says “Go!” 
The world map might be better than the roulette as a starter… or maybe go back to the world map after finishing a level and seeing the next one unlock. World map came out beautiful and I think it is kind of hidden at the moment.


Duuuuude you can see the item in the backpack!

Level selection is spectacular.
Aggretsuko vibes all over the new dynamic with el jefe.

 Game looks and plays beautifully… difficulty could ramp up a bit more slowly at least in the first two levels. Maybe it could move more dynamically in relation to player position.
Would consider moving the camera further back and possibly up slightly. What would be the implications of a change like this?
Can we add slight camera shake or movement tracking the steps? Camera move for the slide? Camera shake on attack? Camera shake on crash.
Got crashes when continuing.
Wall walking is not intuitive. If tutorial is followed you land on middle lane.
We need to look at scripting. Would be great to have all the instances and use outside resources for dialogue etc.

Have NPCs on sidewalk. Have most using crosswalk and some simply jaywalking. Having them stand there unless there is a car or food truck nearby looks weird. Once the NPCs are being taken over by X (aliens) then they become additional obstacles more in line with the story along with the rest of the aliens/zombies/etc. As they take over.

Love the new crash animation. Would have the camera keep moving forward a bit longer at least until the impact. Would also add Bamboo falling off the screen due to the braking of the camera.
