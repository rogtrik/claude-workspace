Movement on map like Snake
Use battle physics engine similar to Weta used on LOTR3. But we are much more zoomed out of the action.
Visually can even be made more comedic and be able to have varying ranges from rated E to rated to M.
Minions or Lemming like creatures that crash into each other and Mad Hatter’s Tea Party like comedy ensues but some players (soldiers) get lost in the partying.
Medieval Battle

Samurai Battle
Historical Battle 
	WW, Civil War, 
Centurion block marches on controlled by a general and two lieutenants as main controls of the troops. The first block to lose their general loses.
Each one of those essential strategic elements are locked in before each round at the front, middle, or back of the unit. 
Each have leveling up that include their range in sensing the enemy or other things, their precision or false alarm hit rate, their reception speed, transmission speed etc.
Generals can behave independently with their section of troops, independently until the end of every battle. 
Signals are passed through a system of flags and symbols depicting different strategies.
