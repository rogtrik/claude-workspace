     **Notes June 2019**

     Still having issues with perspective. Things are bending and twisting in front of me instead of me winding through them.
Scale changes were limited to the surroundings and not the track, obstacles, etc. Right?
Gameplay still feels cramped at times and I can’t get myself motivated to keep going.
At the same time seeing the crap games that there are ads for ours looks fucking great.

     **Ideas**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Add HP and a life bar. Let some bouncing happen.
Simplified powerups
	Double Jump
	Turbo
	Rewind
Coins give HP but in relation to how much money you have.
Bonus multiplier for coins for flawless streaks
Jump height depends on weight
