These feel very strange to me. Thanks to technological advancements in distribution and content delivery, all filmmakers have had a way to reach potentially massive audiences at their disposal now for years. 

Festivals in most cases are profit driven event ventures that do not transfer much value to the content/product they exhibit unless they play the role of a market like is/was the case of the main global fests like Cannes, TIFF, EFM, Sundance etc.

Is this a bad replacement for an old model or the future/present in the world of Supreme. Hype and scarcity to drive value.

Let’s create the future of film festivals
