From the young shepherd boy that arrives for the first time at a cathedral and gets their mind blown by the epic scenes depicted in stained glass, mosaics and architecture that made us feel tiny and in awe of the grandeur… to L’Arrivée d’un trail en gare de La Ciotat causing attendees to get up from their seats and run out of the train’s way… to the crescendo of spectacle films providing near theme park thrills with spatial audio on pin sharp sensorially arresting IMAX screens larger than a cathedral wall.
We crave impactful experiences and we just happen to be a society that hyper focuses on individual aspects to improve while missing the forest for the trees.
