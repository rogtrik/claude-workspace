Would consider simply making it longer… I have seen these have a much longer runtime and I think we have the goods for it. Happy to cut down from there if needed for runtime but covering the whole emotional gamut or have “versions” that are more one emotion like this one as opposed to the entire range.

Think there are also lots of production value shots to be added:

     * Replace Logo moment with other one for ending, El Luchador S2 E1 Material, S2 E10 Material for production value and variety.

     * Panama Looks Good

     * HATYM
