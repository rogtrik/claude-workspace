     To retain more subscribers, SVOD providers are exploring ways to shift the value proposition in their favor. Offering flexible pricing options could be the most direct path. Among consumers in all five countries surveyed, options that allowed people to watch ads in exchange for lower costs—or at no cost—are the most popular (figure 3). Ad-supported tiers could attract more cost-conscious subscribers. And even when there are lulls in engaging content, subscribers may not cancel their subscription if the cost is low enough.

Streaming services can also use gated content to offer consumers pricing tiers. Some companies are experimenting with offering premium access to everything at a higher price and cheaper options for less content. Our global study found that many respondents thinking of cancelling a paid SVOD service would likely keep their subscriptions if they could get a discount. Some would be willing to watch more ads, or less content, or wait 45 days to watch a new release (figure 4).

Bundles and perks can also support subscriber retention. If US respondents were thinking about cancelling an SVOD service, 37% said that access to first-run movies would convince them to stay, and 34% would stay if a loyalty program were included. Among Gen Zs and Millennials, about 51% would stay if their subscription included a gaming or music service or another SVOD service.
