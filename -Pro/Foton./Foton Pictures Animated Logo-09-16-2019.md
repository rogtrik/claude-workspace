… camera with virtual extreme focal length zoom with a microscopic macro blasts off from the dark side of the moon with a forward and up motion, we start to witness an earth-rise that is happening just as the sun is barely creeping over the earth itself… the camera moves at a blinding speed always accelerating more and more. Given the scale of the distances and masses we are seeing it seems almost slow at first. As we pass the moon we begin seeing the sunrise on earth accentuated by the upward (off axis) motion. Faster and faster… there is almost a camera shake given the insane speed at which we are traveling…. as we pass the earth the macro zoom that has been zooming “slowly” as we have been traveling to accentuate speed and size and compress distance suddenly accelerates exponentially to the point at which we discern the rays of light traveling towards us at a speed that the camera almost equals in an opposite direction as the zoom and macro are so drastic that we burst visually in a quantic visual push/pull into a microscopic layer that in which we see a flash of the individual photons looking like particles and behaving as waves and in an equally fast flash the camera circles around a particle as it passes it and against the blackness of space the particle crashes slides burns onto the dot in the logo.
