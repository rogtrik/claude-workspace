Hi Lily

Hope all is great wth you.

We need to make 3 final transfers from my LMA account as soon as possible. In march  we will finally install a more fixed monthly mechanism. Is there a way to automate a minimum transfer to my holding entity?

Please send me any questions and/or confirmation to my email. Thanks.
