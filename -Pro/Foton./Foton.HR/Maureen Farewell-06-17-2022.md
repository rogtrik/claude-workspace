As most of you surely know, we now have to say goodbye to someone that has been an essential part in turning Foton.Games into what it is today. We were a bunch of robots in a jungle before she gave us her time and leadership and we are beyond thankful for it. She leaves to move on to bigger and better things though, and we are very proud as she continues her work within the Embracer Group and championing the incredible talent that Chile and Latin America have to offer to the global games industry. 
We wish you all the best in this new chapter Maureen and know that you continue to count on us for whatever you might need. We look forward to hopefully collaborating again in the future!
Congratulations on seeing your work and talent recognized with such a great opportunity and know that you will be dearly missed. 
Ever upward!

Nimble Giant which is part of the Embracer Group
