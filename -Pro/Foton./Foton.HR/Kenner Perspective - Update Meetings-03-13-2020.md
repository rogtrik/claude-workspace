     **May 9, 2022 - Departure Announcement**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Hi Everyone
As some of you might already know, this past Friday, Kenner informed Ari and me that she will be departing the company effective May 20th.
We are very sad to see her go as there is nothing harder to find when putting together any kind of team, than the kind of commitment, heart and absolute hard working discipline that Kenner brought to our company for more than two years. Her insight into the industry as well as the craft of storytelling and filmmaking is critical for our operation in Foton.Pictures and we are a better company for having had her leadership and influence throughout this time. 
I kindly request that we all try to come together over the next two weeks to help transfer the considerable amount of projects and initiatives that Kenner was handling directly, over to the rest of the team so we can assure a smooth transition for our partners and collaborators. 
We wish Kenner the best vibes wherever she is off to next and we will watch and cheer from afar as she will undoubtedly continue to excel in our industry. Hopefully our paths will cross again and we will get a chance to collaborate in the future.
Thank you Kenner for everything you have given the company and each and every one of us these last two years.

Carlos

     Two weeks notice from Kenner.
Death by a thousand paper cuts with AGAD being what broke the camel’s back.

     **Aug 20, 2021**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Was a good decompression and philosophical session in which the field hopefully expanded, the value proposition of filmed entertainment was shifted and her security at the company was clearly not based on agreeing or not with particulars. Especially when discussing with new perspectives that she has yet to understand. 

She is about to go on her trip and hope that all of this will marinate for a more clear perspective talk mid September.

     **Role, Function and Skillsets**

     **Sourcing Dynamic**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Worry with regards to a feeling of you not wanting to really source in a cold way. Fear of passing too much when that is part of the game of what we do. How did you handle it when you were acquisitions? There seems to be a situation where it is hard for you to separate your own personal relationship and the company’s.

     **Sales Core**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Completely take over all relationships regarding the following projects:
TBC / In post. Need to ramp up efforts off the forthcoming cut.
EB / Most critical / received new cut recently. We are assuming worst case projection scenario given last cut and market climate. In this scenario we would not recoup.
The production is considerably over budget and they are in breach of our agreement. 
Jason our day to day counsel is handling comms as we engage with a better suited firm in the possibility that we choose to take legal action.
Would prefer not to do so as to not jeopardize the existing deals. But those deals correspond to that worst case projection scenario. 
Worth looking at the numbers adding your perspective.

     **Production Finance**

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     We ideally have the capacity to fund 2 more projects at ~200k each. We should immediately connect you with Andrew Gans and Pechter as they are the most at hand co financier we have been talking to. Andrew has “matched” Bending Light on 3 projects. HATYM, CTG, PSA.
