We would be honored to be included as a company within your network of allied producers that take a look at these projects. 
This would also apply for our own non-profit Emergent as we have looked to develop our own similar platform in the future in order to support documentary projects. 
If you are open to it would love for these platforms to be one and the same and see how it could make sense for these organizations to share it. This would combine efforts regarding community generation.
Would you be open in making a parallel platform or subsection for Emergent and other allied Doc specific Network partners?
How are the bursaries structured? We could be interested in participating in them as well?
Is there a possibility of going in sooner together with DCP at a development stage as well?
