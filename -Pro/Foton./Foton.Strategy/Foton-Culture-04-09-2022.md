     Getting your team to peak performance
Trust (got each other back / feel safe)
Honesty / Be direct, truthful

Transparency
Public (Scrumboards)
Creates recognition for high performers
Low performers will self correct
No hiding / honest conversations
Public KPI's with clear Goals
Align Incentives / everyone is working towards the same goals
Public Expense Reports

Authenticity
Weekly Fun Meeting / teams would take turns
The more people feel that they can be themselves the safer they feel and the better risks they will take.
Celebrations & Shoutouts
Not only Victories but also do the fuck ups... 
Love
Ask for help and give help
Employees will bust their ass for you

Focus on Big Rocks
Raise above the minutiae... Focus on the things that will really move the company forward

People will forget what you said... People will forget what you did... But people will never forget how you made them feel.
-Maya Angelou
