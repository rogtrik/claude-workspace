Vision and what I believe
Why we need to do this together.
The help I need for the next 24-36 or 2M-3M in that time. 
You take over for me during that period in exchange for 50/50 excepting certain controls and protections that in most cases will be mutual. 
All that I have put into the company plus my unpaid salary will be turned into debt for the company to be paid back when there is profit.
This should make it much more appealing for you in what you can get in the company for less than what my 50% has represented economically but also think of what it could do to a valuation when the time comes to raise more capital in the future. 
Really believe that this will become one with Ole and all of those businesses. That scenario could mean a nice cash out or even a continually growing partnership in not just Foton.
