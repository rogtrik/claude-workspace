# Foton.

## Foton.Pictures

Groundbreaking Episodic, Games and Feature Film content studio. Founded in partnership with OleCommunications on the belief that Latin American Productions, the Creative Talent and our Stories are of export quality and could perform on equal footing with Hollywood in a newly globalized content market. 

Starting in 2012 Foton Created and Produced Hit Television Content for Latin America, pioneering unscripted formats in historical and investigative documentaries, reality series and crime content while innovating in branded content. During that time the company generated $ in Gross Sales, produced X hours, and raised the bar for Original Productions in the region.

Starting in 2015 Foton began developing, producing and financing English Language, US Originated content for global buyers. Always leaning into the original mission of multimedia storytelling with diverse characters and stories at its core. This allowed Foton to grow into a much more lucrative market that commands larger production budgets and corresponding fees, multiplying the potential for success as a content company. 



Created on the three basic principles, inform entertain and play or alternatively bring light bring joy bring together.


## Foton.Ventures
Starting in 2021 we conclude that the opportunities available in the M&E space far exceed Bending Light’s focus on Feature Film investing 

## Foton.Games 
Starting in 2018 as Jungle Robots, this became the realization of one of the original concepts of the our vision at Foton which was a belief that content, characters and stories would connect with audiences across all media along with the fundamental human need to play. The power bringing people together, helping them understand our world, expanding their boundaries. Put on games has produced for mobile games and a highly efficient manner, providing the groundwork and relationships to evolve into the console gaming space.

After an investment of XXX we have positioned the company as a player in the industry with presence as industry events and are top of mind for indie developers in Latin America and around the world leading to constantly receiving proposals and opportunities in the space.

## Lessons Learned / In Hindsight

Foton. Latin America 2012-2015
Notwithstanding the excellent performance of our content, the budget levels and margins were not in line with the business plan and we lost financial backing. This led to the unwinding of the team and LatAm entities just before the production boom created by the entry of streaming companies into the region that lasted for 7 years until the cutbacks of 2023 from which the region is already recovering.
