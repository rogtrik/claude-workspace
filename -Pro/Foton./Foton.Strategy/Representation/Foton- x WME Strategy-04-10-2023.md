Foton. brand relaunch.

     **Gigante**
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      - We are cutting it real close with the Televisa license of all Sábado Gigante Footage. It has taken much longer than originally expected and they have understandably become uncomfortable given how near-impossible they see the feat of getting these rights. Notwithstanding their own executive’s opinions we are very close to getting this cleared which should unlock everything with Disney. 
In the unlikely scenario that Disney does decide to bow out we believe that with the rights in hand we could make a compelling case to Apple and have been waiting to connect directly with Molly Thompson through some personal relationships from her A&E Indie days.

     **Say Her Name**
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      - The project is in one last push to get financed 5+ Gross budget that should land slightly below 5M using all incentives. Wagner Moura has replaced Benicio in the leading role and we believe creatively and with regards to chemistry with co-lead Adria Arjona it is a better fit. Commercially though we have our doubts and the project has been in the market several times. We boarded 3 years ago in the dev phase and have invested ~75k to date and are committed to provide an additional 1M in equity financing for the production. 
As it stands it would be…
BL 1M / Fremantle, Mary Bickford and other investors in conversations with Fabula and we have it out to two people. 
Curious what you guys think of the project and its chances to raise funding in the current climate not to mention facing the market once the film is produced.

     **Uninvited**
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      We are very close to locking a cut and we have agency Feref out of the UK preparing a trailer for WME to take to Cannes. We are very optimistic with the recent change of editor and think Pedro is having an extremely rare moment that we would love to capitalize on. At the same time we like to manage expectations and would like to get your thoughts.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     **An Advocate**
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      Currently out to writers for a redraft that we hope will be able to proceed notwithstanding the impending strike. Hope is to go out to cast beginning of the summer to hopefully set production for next year.

     **La Tierra de los Salvajes**
 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
      co pro with Fabula - Originally thought with Viggo Mortensen as lead but currently considering him for another role as we recast the lead in favor of more authenticity.

 </span> <span style="font-family: Helvetica-Bold; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     **The Yellow Wallpaper**

Later meetings
Podcasts
We have 3 podcasts in very active development. One as companion content to Gigante diving deeper into the history of latinos with expanded interviews and conversations, one in the mystery space based on strong LatAm IP and one based on the true story of a Basque espionage operation using pirate radio in Venezuela and how they tried to expand ETA’s reach at the time.
Publishing
Currently in conversations with Heavy Metal, IDW and Boom!Studios to explore opportunities in the space. We have 3 projects in conversations to start production in the coming months aiming to release end of this year. 
Games
We recently took our first console game to GDC and continue to expand into the space. We are developing a games focused content vertical for spanish speaking audiences in partnership with OI and we are seeing the success of Last Of Us, Super Mario and the huge bet on the upcoming Fallout being produced by Lisa Joy and John Nolan
Immersive/Experiential
Looking at opportunities with Felix&Paul currently and think with the Apple headset just weeks away the timing is truly better than ever. Thoughts?
Branded
Explore 
Digital
We continue to expand our digital business and think there could be great opportunities in exploring collaborations with WME talent in the space. 

NGL/Mitu

Streaming
We are involved in developing a very complete AVOD/FAST strategy in LatAm and although we were alrady fans from the NeuLion era we think there could be opportunities to explore with Endeavor Streaming and think a connection through you guys would be a great way to restart those conversations.
