## Call on May 29, 2024

We are now almost halfway through the year but still feel the effects of the strike or some larger shift in the industry. 

We are very appreciative of how WME has been able to connect us with some amazing companies and talent but have found very little opportunity for collaboration without considerable investments from us being a prerequisite. 

We have not seen any real change in our ability to move our own projects or access relationships that bring opportunities and financing to our projects as opposed to us always being the financier. 

The situation with Uninvited has led to a very real rethinking of our strategy and how to best adapt to the market realities moving forward. If all goes well with the release of the film, we believe this can become an essential part of our business moving forward. 

Seeing this year’s Sundance fest winner get similar or possibly worse offers than The Uninvited, along with the audience award winner barely breaking even it is very disheartening and now the prevalence of smaller distributors in Cannes filling the void left by studios and streamers I don’t know whether to become more optimistic about expanding during a less competitive time or see the writing on the wall and rethink things even more drastically.

Very curious about how you guys are seeing things for the industry, for WME and for us at Foton in the current landscape. 

Is there a world in which we can shift our focus from producers and those who need financing and move it over to actual buyers and distributors to better adapt our strategy to those opportunities?

Foton. brand relaunch.
**Gigante** - We are cutting it real close with the Televisa license of all Sábado Gigante Footage. It has taken much longer than originally expected and they have understandably become uncomfortable given how near-impossible they see the feat of getting these rights. Notwithstanding their own executive’s opinions we are very close to getting this cleared which should unlock everything with Disney. 
In the unlikely scenario that Disney does decide to bow out we believe that with the rights in hand we could make a compelling case to Apple and have been waiting to connect directly with Molly Thompson through some personal relationships from her A&E Indie days.
**Say Her Name** - The project is in one last push to get financed 5+ Gross budget that should land slightly below 5M using all incentives. Wagner Moura has replaced Benicio in the leading role and we believe creatively and with regards to chemistry with co-lead Adria Arjona it is a better fit. Commercially though we have our doubts and the project has been in the market several times. We boarded 3 years ago in the dev phase and have invested ~75k to date and are committed to provide an additional 1M in equity financing for the production. 
As it stands it would be…
BL 1M / Fremantle, Mary Bickford and other investors in conversations with Fabula and we have it out to two people. 
Curious what you guys think of the project and its chances to raise funding in the current climate not to mention facing the market once the film is produced. 
**Uninvited** We are very close to locking a cut and we have agency Feref out of the UK preparing a trailer for WME to take to Cannes. We are very optimistic with the recent change of editor and think Pedro is having an extremely rare moment that we would love to capitalize on. At the same time we like to manage expectations and would like to get your thoughts.
**An Advocate** Currently out to writers for a redraft that we hope will be able to proceed notwithstanding the impending strike. Hope is to go out to cast beginning of the summer to hopefully set production for next year. 
**Violent Cases** Out to Andrew Garfield. Would love to consider WME talent and explore the possibility of collaborating more fully.
**Peculiar Heart** CLE producing, very promising filmmaker, Angeles Cruz is currently writing. Aiming for next year production. 
**La Tierra de los Salvajes** co pro with Fabula - Originally thought with Viggo Mortensen as lead but currently considering him for another role as we recast the lead in favor of more authenticity.
**The Yellow Wallpaper** Black Barmitzvah and Rehab entertainment co-pro. About to close deal with writer. Strike willing we should have a a draft by end of the summer. 
**Dead Garden’s Bloom** opinions and insight?
**They Wait For Us** Nudge to get it moving again?
**ROM**

Later meetings
Podcasts
We have 3 podcasts in very active development. One as companion content to Gigante diving deeper into the history of latinos with expanded interviews and conversations, one in the mystery space based on strong LatAm IP and one based on the true story of a Basque espionage operation using pirate radio in Venezuela and how they tried to expand ETA’s reach at the time.
Publishing
Currently in conversations with Heavy Metal, IDW and Boom!Studios to explore opportunities in the space. We have 3 projects in conversations to start production in the coming months aiming to release end of this year. 
Games
We recently took our first console game to GDC and continue to expand into the space. We are developing a games focused content vertical for spanish speaking audiences in partnership with OI and we are seeing the success of Last Of Us, Super Mario and the huge bet on the upcoming Fallout being produced by Lisa Joy and John Nolan
Immersive/Experiential
Looking at opportunities with Felix&Paul currently and think with the Apple headset just weeks away the timing is truly better than ever. Thoughts?
Branded
Explore 
Digital
We continue to expand our digital business and think there could be great opportunities in exploring collaborations with WME talent in the space. 

NGL/Mitu

Streaming
We are involved in developing a very complete AVOD/FAST strategy in LatAm and although we were alrady fans from the NeuLion era we think there could be opportunities to explore with Endeavor Streaming and think a connection through you guys would be a great way to restart those conversations.
