Audience Growth

A vertically integrated content company, the ideal environment for fostering talent for the creation of stories, characters and worlds that connect with audiences at a global scale. 

Growing up during the global popularization of video game consoles

Latin American Origins
Foton was created with the dream of sharing the work of Latin American talent, their stories and unique voices with the world. Seeing how technological advancements were bridging the gap between TV and Film, it allowed creators a level of access to production tools, that just a decade prior were completely exclusive to the realm of Hollywood Films. These tools were becoming accesible for all forms of episodic content and exclusive few that had the financial muscle to reach global audiences.


360 in practice / Transmedia
El Luchador Case Study… during a time of consumption habit shifts also driven by technological advances, younger audiences starting become ever more elusive for traditional/legacy media. Our content, and in particular, the transmedia strategy used for the second season of El Luchador proved not only capable of placing a top 40 network among the top 5 in México but also managed to bring the channel’s average age down by almost 15 years, reverting the trend of recent years.

I have always seen production costs as too high for what the product ends up being. Remember during the first season of El Luchador how our measly post budget was enough for a custom buildout for the project.
We can streamline the development, production and business processes.

In a word, we only pick the films we're passionate about–and that have an audience.
