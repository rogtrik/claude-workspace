Thank you Austin and thank you SXSW for another amazing year. What an awesome experience to have had the World Premiere of The Uninvited at the festival and we are so appreciative for all the good vibes from everyone that watched and helped get us to this moment.

We are fully recovered now and still dreaming about the BBQ. See you again next year!

Personal

SXSW has always had a special place in my heart. A gathering of amazing people that has expanded horizons and lead to my evolution as a filmmaker, game developer and entrepreneur. Now a week after my 10th time attending I’m still ecstatic to finally have had a World Premiere at SXSW with our latest film, @Nadias The Uninvited.

After having missed our first opportunity in 2020 with @Kelly’s beautiful first film, @pinkskies, which would have been in competition at SXSW that year, it feels amazing to finally achieve this milestone for @foton.

Thankfully Pink Skies Ahead found an amazing home at Paramount and here’s to The Uninvited following a similar path.

Thank you for coming on this crazy journey all these years. @adri @ari @nat @gus
