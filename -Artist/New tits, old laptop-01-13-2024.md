# New tits, old laptop


Have you ever seen someone with beautiful new tits and a new MacBook Pro? Nooo!!! Why??? Because they cost around the same. And you usually get them for Christmas or after you had a kid, or when you get a new job. Some people get them when they turn 18, some people get them to feel better about themselves, some people never had them before, some had them but they fell. We are not talking about laptops here. It’s tits, boobs, breasts, tetas as my daughter calls them.

Christmas came and Christmas left. I was ready for new tits but my husband said I was due for a new laptop. To which I said, I rather get new tits.




An energy drink for moms called “7AM Drink”

We were hanging out outside in the backyard. As any other modern day couple that’s been married for 15 years, we were in each other’s devices. And all of the sudden, my husband stands up very quickly and says that he’s got bit by a giant ant. To which I ask: Did you see it on top of you? Where is it? 
My husband answered: In the floor. But everything itches now.
With all the calm and patience of a Montessori mom for a 4 years old girl, and when I say that I mean ME. I ask him: Did you see it walking all over you?
I saw it in the floor.

And he replies - Dude! What are you? The fucking lawyer of the bug??? It fucking bit me!!!
