# The Anti Antihero

 <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 14.0;text-align: left;">
     Inspired by all antiheroes he had no other influences and saw that as the goal and ideal to strive for. He fails miserably at this and in the process realizing that he is not an anti hero but in reality is a true hero! A champion that will show what masculinity can be in a post feminism world.
