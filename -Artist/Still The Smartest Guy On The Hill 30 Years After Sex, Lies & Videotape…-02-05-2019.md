     : We were looking for alternative opportunities to show the film. I think Slamdance was in their second year, and they said, we’d love to have it. We had a really fun, semi-notorious screening that night, because this was back in the era of film projectors. The projectors were in the room where the films were shown. They constructed a plywood box that was open on top, to try and deflect some of the sound. Not very successfully. The night we screened, one of the projectors went down. So we could only screen one 20-minute reel at a time. We were keeping the audience aware of what was going on. We’d show these 20-minute reels. The reel would end. The whole room would go, “Ohhh.” The lights would come up. People would start talking, while we changed the reel. Put the new reel up. Lights would go down. They would clap and we would do the next 20-minute section. It ended up being a really crazy night. People were rooting for the movie and Greg and I were standing in the back, passing a bottle of vodka back and forth. So I felt the whole vibe of that was what I wanted to be a part of.

The year of /sex lies/, the festival felt a lot different than it did the following year, when I was on the jury. That is probably inevitable and purely a function of economics and market forces. It was weird to go back the following year and feel that the energy had changed and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.

     : No. It could have been somebody else and it could have been another movie. I was just clocking the fact that there was no going back, that this is the way that it’s going to be now. The festival itself is still fulfilling its original mandate, which is to give a platform to independent filmmakers from all over the world. They’re still doing what they started doing and it’s not really their fault that suddenly a lot of buyers show up. Things have calmed down a bit. There are the inevitable festival deals that sometimes don’t play out the way people anticipated. It’ll be interesting this year to see what the vibe is, because a lot of the companies that would typically be buying films are now shrinking the number of films that they purchase and doing a lot more production themselves. It will be interesting to see if that trend continues and what the effect is on the lives of the films that go to the festival.

     : It’s a great time to be someone who makes things because there are lots of places to go and they’re all hungry for content. That’s the good news. The obvious problem is how to draw eyeballs to your project against a level of competition that was unimaginable when I was coming up in the business. I would never have thought people would be targeted with so much content all day, every day. I just couldn’t have imagined it. Given it’s impossible to get eyes on everything, I think most people are looking for a filter. That can come in a variety of guises. It can be a filmmaker, it can be a genre, it could be a certain platform that you’ve become loyal to. Any of these things can help the viewer cleave their way through all of these options, but it’s hard. Like I said, it’s a great time to be making stuff. It’s just harder and harder to be the signal in the midst of all the noise.

Don’t tell me that there isn’t a business out there. The question becomes, what’s working theatrically? So that’s the more relevant question for me as a filmmaker. What’s working?

     : That was one of them, yeah. I had a bunch. Typically, you cannot get out of bed for under $30 million in marketing and it’s probably going up from there. I felt with a strategically targeted campaign, you ought to be able to do it for $20 million. My concern was, the implications of skyrocketing marketing costs are dire for creative people. So I wanted to see if it was possible. It didn’t work on /Logan./ I got the opportunity to do it again on /Unsane/. It didn’t work again. The bottom line: $20 million is not enough for a wide-release film to generate the level of awareness that you have to have. It’s just not.

Talk shows, junkets, all that stuff that I always wonder, what is this for? What is this doing? If they work, why do movies tank while other movies don’t do anything and they take off? There is this whole other ecosystem that just deals with PR and all that stuff. Just talk to the people over at the Four Seasons. I wanted to test a theory. Could you increase awareness by generating direct contact between, let’s say, your talent and the audience, and draw people toward a film? Chan

     : Well, I think you’re right in that the other thing…on /Logan Lucky/ we put a disproportionate amount of our money into digital and a very small amount into TV. I decided to reverse that ratio on /Unsane/, because my takeaway from /Logan Lucky/ is forgetting about awareness, and that it’s still, for all its inefficiency, a good way to get a lot of eyeballs on your movie through commercials. I think there’s also a psychological component that’s tricky to quantify. Which is, if people don’t see commercials for your movie, they don’t think it’s a real movie. Seriously. Real movies advertise on TV. I think that’s how people think. So if they didn’t see your commercial, they’re like, that must be some off-market thing. Because I see ads on my favorite shows for real movies. So we tried that on /Unsane/. It still didn’t work.

     : Absolutely. I’m like, that’s Haley’s Comet. You have to do everything you can to make that happen, as quickly as possible. That was part of the reason for us to self-finance. We needed to start right away and so neither of us wanted to talk to anybody. We just wanted to go and do it. I knew that was a very commercial idea. I ended up doing the same thing on /Unsane/ and /High Flying Bird/, but for different reasons. Strictly, I just wanted to go and do this without talking to anyone or clearing it with anybody. I just want to be able to go do it. I tried to keep them as quiet as possible while we were doing it because I think it’s fun when stuff sort of pops up that you didn’t know about.

Again, despite the conversation about the whole fingerprint distribution experiment, /Unsane/ was still economically a nice thing for all of us to be involved with. It was not an expensive movie to make and we were able to make deals where everybody got some checks, so that’s nice. What I’m trying to figure out going forward is what lane should I be driving in right now, and, am I being too small? Should I be restricting myself to any one lane or should I be moving on multiple fronts? I’ve got several projects going both as a director and a producer that are in various stages of development.

     : I don’t have that skill-set. I’m not a snob; I just don’t think I would be very good. Fantasy spectacle is just not my thing. I didn’t read it growing up. I just have no feel for it. I would end up stripping it of everything that made people want to go see it in the first place. So it’s just not a good match for me. It’s not that I find it culturally destructive. I’m just not the audience for it. I can’t make something that I wouldn’t stand in line to go see.

I agree with you. Look what Brad Bird did with the two /Incredibles/ movies. Those are amazing. By any standard, those are classics. He can do that. I can’t. I’ve got to focus on the things that I can do and try to get better at that. So what’s nice to me about /High Flying Bird/ dropping essentially 30 years to the week of /sex lies & videotape/ is, it’s another two-people-in-a-room movie. That’s how I started, and I’ve always believed that no matter how big a sort of historical context that you’re trying to portray in a story, you can ultimately trace it back to two people in a room. I’m happy that I haven’t lost that belief and that interest in close-quarter physical and psychological interaction. It still is as interesting to me as it ever was.

     : Two things. One, the ability to play visually in a way that isn’t always appropriate for a different kind of movie. I had a license there to have fun with the images and the cutting patterns and the music, which felt organic to those movies but in another context might have felt weird or too self-conscious. I viewed those movies as these giant, moving Lichtenstein panels. They were like comic books to me. That’s how I imagined them. So there was that and underneath all that they were odes to professionalism and process and fraternity, and how to deal with pressure. How to treat people that worked for you and with you. All that other stuff that I’m interested in is moving along below the surface of all that.

   “Ocean’s Eleven”

So I loved doing those films. Compared to other things I’ve done, they were not easy. It’s harder than you think to make something look breezy but that still has a very defined visual and narrative architecture. It is not often I get stuck on a set, truly stuck, like send-everybody-away-because-I-need-to-think-about-this-problem-and-the-answer-isn’t-coming kind of hard. That doesn’t happen to me often but 85% of when it has happened, it has been on an /Ocean’s/ film. Literally watching a scene and just going, I don’t have an idea. I don’t have an organizing principle of how to shoot this scene.

     : I’ll keep running it for a while and see if something dislodges or if somebody comes up with an idea or suggestion. I’ll let that run its course for a while and then if nothing’s coming, I will send everybody away. I remember on /Ocean’s Twelve/, we had this dialogue scene. It was scheduled for day-and-a-half. I sent everybody away…I wrapped at lunch the first day because I didn’t know how I wanted to do it. I spent that afternoon thinking about it, looking at other things that were around it and finally came up with, if not the perfect solve, at least something that I felt good about. We finished it by lunch the next day because once you have the idea, it goes really fast. I try to screen those movies as soon as we wrap and usually within a week I have it put together.

     : With today’s technology? Absolutely. It’s the Pixar motto, be wrong as fast as you can. I want people to see it as quickly as possible so I can get a sense of what we have, or don’t have. In the case of /Ocean’s Thirteen/, it was clear the narrative was malnourished in some way and there needed to be another major component to the whole thing. So the good news was we were under budget and the writers and I gathered and came up with a solve that took seven days of shooting. We had a screening at Warner Bros a week after the movie wraps. All my friends are there and everybody knows, we have a problem. Alan Horn, bless his heart, just came up and basically said, “Well, I’ll leave you to it.” Because he knew I knew. There was nothing to say and he knew it’s on me to figure this out with some help from my friends. When we previewed the finished film in Phoenix and it went very well, Alan came up and said, “I’ve never seen a transformation like that in my entire career. What I saw two-and-a-half months ago and what I saw tonight. I’m so happy.” I said I’m happy you’re happy but more than anything, I’m just relieved. In /Ocean’s Thirteen/, all of that Eddie Izzard stuff, the computer stuff with Julian Sands, that was all new. Anything that Eddie had to do with in that movie and that new system that Al Pacino was presiding over, The Greco, that didn’t exist, none of it.

     : Jerry Weintraub was the main reason, and the other was the generosity of George and Brad and Matt in essentially keeping the same deal that they had for all three movies. And just increasing the pot that everybody else was able to participate in, including me. They were real stand-up guys about that because they knew if we don’t do this, we’re not going to be able to make the movies and we all felt we’d rather do them. They were fun. On those three films I think if you asked any of the cast they were fun movies for them because nobody had to shoulder the whole thing. It was a fun group. They were having more pure pleasure in the moment than I was. My pleasures were delayed. I’m really happy to have been involved with a franchise that performed like that, in which for all intents and purposes, there was no violence. Guns didn’t matter.

     : This is a no-brainer. This guy’s ridiculously talented. Why wouldn’t you want to meet with him? That was certainly my sensation when I saw /Memento/, for instance, and I saw it because again Dan Aloni called me and said will you do me a favor? I’ve got this movie made by this client. It’s done the festival circuit. People seem to really like it a lot. It’s gotten great press and nobody will buy it. We can’t get a distributor. Will you watch this thing and tell me, have people just been gas-lighting us? I watched the movie in a screening room alone. My first reaction was one of real depression, because I thought if that can’t get a distributor then what is happening in this business? What ended up happening is the chief financier, Newmarket, ended up forming their own distribution company and the movie made $25 million here. So it ended up being a success story. But I was sort of having two reactions at once. Why won’t anybody buy this movie, and, there’s a new kid in town. This is like an incredible showcase for someone who we’re now going to know who Christopher Nolan is.

I love the idea that whenever we’re bitching and moaning about some aspect of the business, unbeknownst to us somebody somewhere is working on something that in like six months is going to blow us away, and we have no awareness of. I love that. It always happens.

We were swapping books, making time to talk every so often without any defined purpose other than we liked talking to each other. Then it sort of gradually evolved into ideas. This one kind of came to the surface before some of the others primarily because its scale fit it within the box of we can just go do that on our own. I like things that fit in that box. Some of the other ideas we discussed were just too big to be able to do on our own.

     : It depends. It didn’t happen because a couple weeks before it solidified, Barry Diller sold USA to Universal. It was critical that USA be Switzerland in a sense, for this to work. In the immediate aftermath of that, as interesting as that could have been and as hard as we worked on the structure of it to make sure that it had its best chance of working, I felt that no matter how good the deal or structure, if you don’t control distribution you’re still working for the man.

The only scenario I think I would ever try to revive an idea like that would be in a situation in which the makers of it, the owners of that company, the filmmakers would control and own the distribution. Now, there are a couple different ways to do that but as you said, starting these companies is hard. It’s hard. I spent a couple years kicking around the idea of starting a platform, a content platform from scratch and determined ultimately that it was axiomatic if it was going to work the way I wanted it to work that I had to be the person administering it and therefore I wouldn’t be able to do my day job as often or as successfully as I would like.

I don’t think anybody who’s trying to be on the right side of history here should be surprised that any creative person from any spectrum is going to have an immediate physical reaction to anything that sounds like the culture police. Artists tend to not want to be told what to do. Now, everybody should understand that you tell a writer or filmmaker what they can or can’t do…whether in a larger context you’re right or not, they’re going to react. What I would suggest is they’ve got to count to 10 and sort of think in terms of the 50-year rule. Like, 50 years from now, how will we look back and determine was that the right call?
